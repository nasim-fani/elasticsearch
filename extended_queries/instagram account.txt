    "claim": "News media outlets misrepresented a photograph of a two-year-old migrant girl whose mother was arrested at the U.S-Mexico border as depicting an instance of family separation.",
    "content": " Editor\u2019s Note: This article is an updated version of the original from 22 June 2018, which has been rewritten to better frame the issue, provide additional detail, and correct errors, omissions, or ambiguities in the previous version. In June 2018, as the controversy surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d immigration policy that led to more than 2,000 undocumented migrant children being separated from their parents grew to a fever pitch, a photograph of a sobbing, 2-year-old Honduran refugee came to stand, in the minds of many, for everything that was wrong with that policy. In the minds of others, however, it came to represent bias and dishonesty in the media, for although it wasn\u2019t clear at the outset whether the girl had actually been separated from her mother (it was eventually determined that she was not), the image was widely used to illustrate press coverage of the policy and dominated the news cycle for days. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders condemned the image\u2019s use in a 22 June tweet:  It\u2019s shameful that dems and the media exploited this photo of a little girl to push their agenda. She was not separated from her mom. The separation here is from the facts. Dems should join POTUS and fix our broken immigration system. #ChangetheLawshttps://t.co/Y6KrTp4Ulk \u2014 Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) June 22, 2018          The Daily Wire, among other pro-Trump web sites, objected that media organizations who published the image were attempting to score political points under false pretenses: [T]he media and the Democrats used the photo to try to portray the Trump administration as being heartless toward immigrants, specifically young children. Various individuals on the political Left then used the photo to score political points, either suggesting or stating as fact that she had been separated from her family. And even the mainstream Washington Post ran an opinion piece critical of what the author termed the \u201cmisleading\u201d use of the image: The implication was clear: This was a girl who, like 2,500 other children, was being separated from her mother. Time and many others made a decision to suggest that this was an example of Trump uprooting our American ideals. But that\u2019s not what it was. As The Washington Post\u2018s Samantha Schmidt and Kristine Phillips report, the girl\u2019s father says the child and her mother were never separated. U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed it, as did the Honduran deputy foreign minister. But while the implication that the child was separated from a parent was widespread, to call it misleading is to suggest that the outlets who ran the image knew all along that no such separation took place. Moreover, whether the girl was ultimately taken from her mother or not, the photograph documents a real instance of the enforcement of the zero-tolerance policy that could have led to separation. And although it was contextualized in terms of family separation from its earliest public iteration, the number of times news media organizations explicitly claimed that the photograph depicted a child being taken from her parent can be counted on one hand. The picture was snapped on 12 June 2018 by Getty Images photographer John Moore near McAllen, Texas, during a ride-along with Border Patrol agents as they took asylum seekers from Central America into custody. Moore posted the picture the next day on his personal Instagram page with commentary noting that the administration\u2019s zero-tolerance policy meant that children would be separated from their parents in detention:       A Honduran asylum seeker, 2, and her mother are taken into custody by federal agents near the US-Mexico border. They had just crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico and were to be transported to a US Customs and Border Protection processing center. The Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for undocumented immigrants calls for the separation of parents and children while their cases for political asylum are adjudicated, a process that can take months \u2013 or years. As a father myself, this photograph was especially difficult for me to take. It is one from a series i took while on a ride-along with the Border Patrol in Texas\u2019 R\u00edo Grande Valley. #gettyimages #undocumented #gettyimagesnews A post shared by  John Moore (@jbmoorephoto) on Jun 13, 2018 at 10:48am PDT           The image went mainstream two days later (on 14 June) atop a GettyImages.com feature highlighting Moore\u2019s photographs of what was termed \u201csoon-to-be-separated migrant families\u201d under the title \u201cWhen the Government Takes Your Children.\u201d The text didn\u2019t indicate what ultimately happened to the girl and her mother, although Moore was quoted as saying he last saw them entering a transport van together. (The headline of the article was subsequently changed to \u201cThe Face of Zero Tolerance,\u201d and the phrase \u201csoon-to-be-separated\u201d was deleted. An editor\u2019s note said the article was updated \u201cto reflect new information regarding the government\u2019s policy as well as the families in these photos.\u201d) The image began turning up in national and regional news publications that same day. Among the first to use the image was the Houston Chronicle, which ran it in a 14 June story about immigrant detention centers above a boilerplate caption (presumably supplied by Getty) that would accompany the photograph in dozens more venues in the several days that followed, including the Baltimore Sun, Newsday, New York magazine, BuzzFeed News, and the web site of National Public Radio. The caption did not say that mother and daughter had been separated, but rather that they faced \u201cpossible separation\u201d at a U.S. Border Patrol processing center: A two-year-old Honduran asylum seeker cries as her mother is searched and detained near the U.S.-Mexico border on June 12, 2018 in McAllen, Texas. The asylum seekers had rafted across the Rio Grande from Mexico and were detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents before being sent to a processing center for possible separation. Other venues, while they did use the photograph to illustrate articles about family separation, made no specific claims about what it did or did not depict (these included the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, ABC News, the Daily Beast, and Vanity Fair). Still other outlets went the opposite way, stating more than they knew. On 18 June, in a Business Insider article quoting John Moore on his feelings about taking the photograph, the author described it as depicting \u201can asylum-seeking young girl crying at a detention center as Border Patrol agents questioned her mother before separating them.\u201d On 19 June, the New York  Daily News featured the image in an article headlined \u201cPhotographer Describes Harrowing New Images Showing 2-Year-Old Girl Bawling as She\u2019s Separated from Mother at U.S. Border.\u201d        And, on 21 June, in a story recounting the genesis of what was undoubtedly the most controversial use of Moore\u2019s photograph \u2014 a TIME magazine cover juxtaposing the image of the diminutive migrant girl with that of a towering Donald Trump \u2014 the Washington Post described the subject matter of the original as \u201ca young girl crying as her mother was patted down by a Border Patrol agent before the two were separated.\u201d Compounding the Post\u2018s error was the fact that the Daily Mail Online (which itself had previously run a story describing the photograph as showing a \u201ccrying two-year-old asylum seeker being separated from her mom\u201d) published an interview with the girl\u2019s father that same day in which he denied that the mother and daughter were ever separated. Reuters followed up with their own interview with the father, Denis Valera, who said, again, that the two had been detained together, not separately. Honduras deputy foreign minister Nelly Jerez confirmed Valera\u2019s claims. The Post corrected their article as follows: Clarification: The initial version of this story said the child depicted on Time\u2019s cover had been separated from her mother, based on the magazine\u2019s account. As The Washington Post and others have since reported, the child was not separated from her mother during their encounter with a Border Patrol agent. The story has been updated. The TIME article referenced in the correction was published on 19 June. The magazine had issued a correction as well: Correction (Posted June 19): The original version of this story misstated what happened to the girl in the photo after she was taken from the scene. The girl was not carried away screaming by U.S. Border Patrol agents; her mother picked her up and the two were taken away together. By the time the truth about the image was sorted out, President Trump had signed an executive order calling a halt to family separations (though not to the underlying zero-tolerance policy that led to the separations). In addition to covering Trump\u2019s order and its implications for immigrant families, many of the news organizations that had previously run the photograph published reports setting the record straight about its content. It would be difficult to make the case that John Moore\u2019s gripping image did not play a crucial role in causing a reversal of the family separation policy. But it\u2019s just as difficult to make the case that its emotional impact derived from a misrepresentation of its content. As TIME\u2018s editor-in-chief, Edward Felsenthal, told CNN, \u201cNone of us in the media who used the photo knew what had happened to the girl after this precise moment. And I actually think part of the power of the image is that unknown.\u201d In an official statement, Felsenthal added: The June 12 photograph of the 2-year-old Honduran girl became the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate in America for a reason: Under the policy enforced by the administration, prior to its reversal this week, those who crossed the border illegally were criminally prosecuted, which in turn resulted in the separation of children and parents. Our cover and our reporting capture the stakes of this moment. "

    "content": " Shortly after a gunman in claimed the lives of 17 people in a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018, readers began asking whether a story about Chris Williams, a purported student wounded while shielding classmates during the shooting, was true. The origin of the story appears to be a 15 February Facebook post, which has since been deleted:  It is true that a student was shot while saving his classmates by closing and locking a door so that the gunman couldn\u2019t get to them (which contradicts the false story that students were trapped \u201cafter teachers locked doors\u201d). His name is Anthony Borges. According to several reports, he was initially in critical condition after the shooting, but his condition has stabilized as of this writing. A school coach and a security guard also died while trying to save students.  The story about Chris Williams, on the other hand, is not true.  Even after the original post was deleted, copied and pasted versions of the claim continued to circulate. Yet, no news stories mentioned a student named Chris Williams injured in the Parkland shooting, nor did any describe his heroic actions.         The image of the young man in the photograph likely originated on his Instagram account, where another image shows him in the same setting, viewed from a different angle. The photograph used in the viral Facebook post has also appeared on other web sites.  A woman claiming to be the grandmother of the person in the viral post said the story was not true \u2014 both in comments on a copied and pasted version of the post and on her own timeline:   In a separate post on a separate Facebook account, the person depicted in the photograph reiterated that he was in fact alive (and his name was not \u201cChris Williams\u201d):  "

    "claim": "Pope Francis uploaded a selfie to the Vatican's Instagram account.",
    "content": " On 14 December 2015, multiple web sites carried news of what was purportedly Pope Francis\u2019 \u201cfirst selfie\u201d (published to an Instagram account that appeared to belong to the Vatican):    @catholicworld #popeFrancis #papaFrancesco #papaFrancisco #papstFranziskus #papeFran\u00e7ois #\u043f\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0441\u043a A photo posted by VATICAN.VA (@vatican__) on Dec 14, 2015 at 2:15am PST   Among outlets sharing the Papal selfie was CNN; video of that brief coverage was captured by a separate Twitter account:  .@Pontifex posts on Instagram \u2014 be honest, have you seen a better selfie? https://t.co/ZxAnvYl12F \u2014 New Day (@NewDay) December 14, 2015          While the claim was believable given Pope Francis\u2019 reputation for being progressive and technologically adept, it was ultimately false. The image (not a \u201cselfie\u201d in the strictest \u201cself-taken\u201d sense) appeared to have been captured from a video chat between Pope Francis and young Catholics around the world. At roughly the 01:23 mark of the video, a nervous young man can be seen inadvertently reading aloud a directive not to get nervous. In turn, His Holiness laughed:  The web site Mashable confirmed with the Vatican that the Pope neither maintained nor was involved with the Instagram account that published the fake selfie. Previous rumors attached to the Pope falsely held that he said it was not necessary to believe in God, that he declared all religions were \u201ctrue,\u201d that he officially endorsed Bernie Sanders, that he did an impressive magic trick involving a tablecloth, that he revised Catholic doctrine to permit fornication, and that he stated beloved pets go to heaven.

    "claim": "A photograph shows former President Bill Clinton with convicted sex offender George Nader. ",
    "content": " A set of photographs showing former President Bill Clinton on vacation is frequently shared online by conspiracy-minded websites and social media users, along with the claim that the pictures show him with his arms around a convicted sex offender named George Nader. This rumor was first promulgated by proponents of the \u201cQanon\u201d conspiracy theory in March 2018 after it was revealed that Nader, a key witness in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election, had previously been convicted on charges related to child pornography:  The images were subsequently picked up by websites such as True Pundit, The Event Chronicle,, and News Punch and posted in articles that alluded to some sort of nefarious activity involving Clinton, pedophilia, and the Mueller investigation. Here\u2019s how True Pundit presented these images in March 2018: BUSTED: Mueller\u2019s New Star Witness Against Trump Caught Partying at Exclusive Island Resort with Bill Clinton \u2026 George Nader testified last week to the Mueller grand jury. Mr. Nader is an adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates. According to The Times, Mr. Mueller is investigating whether Emirati money found its way to the Trump campaign, which would be illegal. That sounds very official and all but perhaps Mueller might ask his new star witness in the Trump investigation what he was doing partying on an exclusive island resort with Bill Clinton. Especially when The Clinton\u2019s have been caught helping fund the bogus Trump dossier which helped launch Mueller\u2019s probe. Optics here. Very bad.          Interest was renewed in these images in June 2019, after Nader was brought up on another set of charges related to child pornography. A tweet from \u201cPraying Medic,\u201d a Twitter user described as a \u201cQanon Researcher\u201d in the account\u2019s bio, was shared more than 2000 times:  The above-displayed images are real, and they truly show Clinton posing with a man named George Nader. However, this is not the same George Nader who has a record of child-pornography charges and who was a key witness in Mueller\u2019s investigation. The man seen in this picture is actually an art entrepreneur who happens to share a name with the convicted sex offender mentioned in the Mueller Report. These images were taken in January 2017 during Clinton\u2019s vacation to Casa de Campo in the Dominican Republic. A number of Spanish-language news outlets received the images and published them in articles about the former president\u2019s trip. Diaspora Dominicana, for example, reported at the time as follows: LA ROMANA, Dominican Republic.- The former president of the United States, Bill Clinton, is on vacation in the Dominican Republic. He is spending his vacations in Casa de Campo, La Romana, in the residence of his friend and fellow student Ronald Gonzalez Bunster, a renowned entrepreneur with great interests in the electrical and tourism sectors of the Dominican Republic. Many of the pictured individuals were identified by these news outlets, including the person to Clinton\u2019s left. While these outlets identified this person as \u201cGeorge Nader,\u201d they also described him as an \u201cartistic entrepreneur,\u201d a description that does not fit the Nader involved in Mueller\u2019s probe, who is a businessman and lobbyist: (Clinton) is spending his vacations in Casa de Campo, La Romana, in the residence of his friend and fellow student Ronald Gonzalez Bunster, a renowned entrepreneur with great interests in the electrical and tourism sectors of the Dominican Republic \u2026 In the photos appears the artistic entrepreneur George Nader Ricardo Cheaz, Dominican businessman, of oriental descent. The note received by Accent, along with the photographs is very eloquent. It says the following: \u201cIn Palmilla. Former President Clinton is on vacation. Playing golf and enjoying Palmilla with his Dominican friends.\u201d A family of artistic entrepreneurs with the surname Nader are active in the Dominican Republic. Georges S. Nader opened his first gallery in Port-au-Prince Haiti in 1966, and since then his family has expanded the business with galleries in Miami and Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. George Nader the artistic entrepreneur shared one of these photographs to his Instagram page in January 2017:  We reached out to Nader\u2019s company, Nader Enterprises, to confirm it was indeed him in the photograph. The company told us via email that \u201cIt\u2019s George Nader but not the pedophile!\u201d The websites sharing these images as if they showed Clinton with a sex offender are basing that claim solely on the fact that the pictured man shares a name with an individual involved in Mueller\u2019s investigation. Two people having the same name is quite common, however, and does not make them the same person. "

    "claim": "Bill Maher and Michael Moore sneaked onto Donald Trump's plane and stole his tax returns.",
    "content": " On 28 August 2016, comedian Bill Maher and filmmaker Michael Moore engaged in what was a fairly obvious humor bit on social media regarding the much discussed tax returns of Donald Trump. As of late August 2016, Trump had not made his tax returns public, despite a decades-long tradition among politicians seeking office to do so. On 28 August 2016, Moore published a series of tweets and an Instagram post while apparently attending a baseball game with Maher:   Blocks from the \u201cbirthplace\u201d of Donald J. Trump in Queens (we believe he was actually born in\u2026 https://t.co/9JlI7EcE8a \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) August 28, 2016 So sitting next 2 the Mets stadium is LaGuardiaAirport-&amp; what do u think is sitting there in full view?

Bill saw it last night when he landed there and posted on Instagram that he ran up the stairs and into Trump\u2019s jet and \u201cstole his peanuts.\u201d A day later, the plane is still parked there! So we had an idea. I said,\u201dBill, you know he\u2019s probably been guarding those tax returns he doesn\u2019t want anyone to see with his life. He probably takes them with him wherever he goes! They\u2019re probably sitting on that plane right now!\u201d So Bill runs up the steps and onto Trump\u2019s plane and re-emerges with\u2026wait\u2026 Trump\u2019s tax returns! So easy! The stunt received some media coverage (as it involved two high-profile, politically involved entertainment figures) most of which consistently framed it as a joke.  However, within days, social media users began believing that the claim was meant to be straightforward. Neither Moore nor Maher explained the mechanics of the bit (such as how they came to be on the steps of what looked like Trump\u2019s plane, or on a presumably secured LaGuardia runway), further advancing the idea the claim was genuine.  The likeliest explanation for the photographs was that Maher and Moore were in the process of boarding a private plane that happened to be adjacent to a Trump jet, and Maher was simply photographed holding a plain folder on and next to the craft\u2019s steps.  No part of the tweets suggested that the stunt was anything but a humorous take on the absence of Trump\u2019s tax returns, and neither Moore nor Maher has referenced the bit in any way since the 28 August 2016 tweets were published (as they certainly would have had they captured a major election year scoop). Even if the the scenario took place \u2014 presuming Maher boarded a Trump plane without permission with the intent of \u201csnatching\u201d private documents \u2014 there was no plausible reason that Trump\u2019s personal papers would be stored on the jet, or that an aircraft transporting a high-profile presidential candidate would be unsecured on a relatively public runway.

The photograph was unliked on November 14, after CNA asked the Holy See Press Office for comment.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t \u201cunliked\u201d before Garibotto\u2019s management company, Coy Co., captured a screenshot, which it posted to its own Instagram account, along with the comment that it had received the \u201cPOPE\u2019S OFFICIAL BLESSING.\u201d To be clear, the Pope\u2019s social media accounts are managed by a team, not Francis himself. The Vatican launched an investigation into the matter. "

    "claim": "Social media personality Mia Khalifa insulted Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai after he messaged her on Instagram.",
    "content": " On 16 December 2017, entertainment web site Huzlers.com published an article appearing to report that former porn actress and current social media pundit Mia Khalifa insulted Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai after he sent her flirtatious direct messages on Twitter: Adult actress Mia Khalifa reportedly exposed FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai via Instagram with a screenshotted post of Ajit Pai sliding in her Twitter direct messages. Although Mia reportedly deleted the post in less than 5 minutes, it gained over 2,000 likes, 300 comments, and was screenshotted by many followers. Huzlers also claimed to have a screenshot of the exchange:  Although Mia Khalifa has a history of publicly shaming people who try to \u201cslide into her DMs\u201d (a humorous meme that involves sending someone a direct message for the express purpose of trying to flirt with them, usually invoking maximum awkwardness) this image does not document a real exchange between Khalifa and Pai.         Huzlers.com is an entertainment web site that does not publish genuine news items. A disclaimer at the very bottom of every page reads:  Huzlers.com is the most infamous fauxtire &amp; satire entertainment website in the world. If it\u2019s trending on social media you\u2019ll find it here! This article is not a genuine news story, but it did come close enough to the truth that many people believed (or wanted to believe) it was real, as not only has Khalifa publicly shamed unwanted suitors on social media before, she is also clearly not a fan of Ajit Pai\u2019s or the decision to repeal net neutrality.  For example, Khalifa tweeted, then deleted, the following message about the FCC commissioner on 14 December 2017, showing bleach being poured into a pint glass and bearing the following message:  Every bartender in DC gonna have a secret menu for when @AjitPaiFCC walks in from now on #NetNeutrality   "

    "claim": "President Ronald Reagan once said, \u201cNancy Pelosi is extremely evil\u201d because she is a member of the politically connected D'Alesandro family. ",
    "content": " As any victim of 2017\u2019s Fyre Festival would surely tell you, just because someone posted something on Instagram does not mean that post was in any way a representation of reality. Case in point: a post from an Instagram user  published on 20 January 2019 alleging that President Ronald Reagan, at some indeterminate point in time, had described Nancy Pelosi as \u201cextremely evil\u201d:  Displaying a flawed understanding of both the constitutional power granted to United States presidents as well as standard punctuation, the poster suggested \u201cit\u2019s time Trump exercises his right of reduction in force and get rid of this b****\u201d, referring to Pelosi. The post, which included hashtags such as \u201c#endtimes\u201d, \u201c#islam\u201d and \u201c#libtards\u201d, was the earliest reference we\u2019ve found to this alleged Reagan quote. The meme has since been shared by numerous other accounts that promote the QAnon conspiracy theory.  We found no record of Reagan\u2019s ever making such a statement in any public forum. We reached out to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to ask if there was any possibility the 40th president ever uttered anything close to these words, and Michael Pinckney, an archivist with the library, told us in response that \u201cI couldn\u2019t find any source for this quote. I researched President Reagan public speeches and Nancy Pelosi doesn\u2019t even show up. [I] also researched our open papers and again, her name doesn\u2019t come up.\u201d \u201cOn a personal level,\u201d Pinckney told us via email, \u201cthis doesn\u2019t sound like something President Reagan would say.\u201d Joanne Drake, the Chief Administrative Officer for the Reagan Foundation, concurred. Via email, she told us \u201cPresident Ronald Reagan never spoke those words at any time \u2013 and never would.\u201d Although Nancy Pelosi\u2019s time in national politics began in 1987, at the tail end of Reagan\u2019s presidency and political career, the Pelosi family and the Reagan family (both from California) have enjoyed cordial relations. At the unveiling of a Ronald Reagan statue in June 2009, for example, Nancy Reagan and Nancy Pelosi shared these words: Pelosi \u2026 noted [President Reagan\u2019s] civility, a quality that has since all but vanished in Washington. \u201cEver a gentleman, he never questioned the motives of the person because he knew people in public office loved our country and acted on behalf of the American people,\u201d Pelosi said. Former first lady Nancy Reagan, 87, whose last visit to the Rotunda was when her husband lay in state there five years ago, singled out the speaker among the many dignitaries gathered. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to her,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody else, too, but particularly Nancy.\u201d Her voice breaking, Nancy Reagan added, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be back under happier circumstances,\u201d With that, the two women, both dressed in white, warmly embraced and turned to unveil the enormous bronze likeness. It is true that Nancy Pelosi hails from a powerful family of Baltimore Democrats. Her father, Thomas D\u2019Alesandro Jr., \u201cserved 22 consecutive terms in public office, from state delegate to city councilman to U.S. congressman to Baltimore mayor, followed by a low-level appointment from President John F. Kennedy to something called the Federal Renegotiation Board.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s brother, Thomas D\u2019Alesandro III, has also served as mayor of Baltimore. Because this quote only emerged 14 years after Reagan\u2019s death as an unattributed, unsourced Instagram meme for \u201c#libtards,\u201d because we found no evidence to support the notion that Reagan ever said anything close to these words, and because the sentiment expressed does not sound like something Ronald Reagan would say, we rate this claim as false.

    "claim": "An Instagram account linked to suspected shooter Nikolas Cruz featured an avatar that included a \"MAGA\" hat.",
    "content": " In the aftermath of a 14 February 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida that left at least seventeen people dead, the Internet brimmed over with rumors and disinformation about suspected shooter Nikolas Cruz. Was he a Dreamer? No. A registered Democrat? No. Was he pictured in an \u201cantifa t-shirt\u201d? No. Was he photographed in a hat bearing President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign slogan, \u201cMAGA\u201d (\u201cMake America Great Again\u201d)?  The MAGA hat rumor was based on the profile picture of Instagram account \u201cNikolasCruzMakarov.\u201d The account has since been deleted (you can see an archived version here) but screenshots of the page have already traveled far and wide on social media:   The images from this account were included in a number of articles from credible news sources. Still, some claimed that the \u201cnikolascruzmakarov\u201d account was a hoax, and that the suspected shooter\u2019s real account was actually located under \u201ccruz_nikolas\u201d (forgetting, apparently, that individuals can and often do open more than one account on social media.) Others asserted that the \u201cnikolascruzmakarov\u201d account was created after the shooting in order to frame the suspected shooter as a Trump supporter:           Students who knew Cruz confirmed to the Miami Herald that the \u201ccruz_nikolas\u201d Instagram page was authentic; the web site Heavy.com reported that it had verified the \u201cnikolascruzmakarov\u201d page. Instagram also seemingly confirmed the authenticity of these account when responding to a question posed by Guardian reporter Jon Swain:    Instagram implicitly confirming that an account with a MAGA Trump hat avatar belonged to gunman Nikolas Cruz. Asked why the account was removed, spokesperson says: pic.twitter.com/LdXb73iCj8 \u2014 Jon Swaine (@jonswaine) February 15, 2018  This is a terrible tragedy and our hearts go out to the people who have been affected. There is absolutely no place on our platforms for people who commit such horrendous acts. We have found and immediately deleted the shooter\u2019s accounts on Facebook and instagram. Broward Sheriff Scott Israel also seemed to confirm that the \u201cnikolascruzmakarov\u201d account was authentic when he said that Cruz had posted disturbing photographs of dead lizards to social media: Speaking on WIOD-610 AM radio Thursday morning, Broward Sheriff Scott Israel said Cruz had posted troubling photos and videos on social media. \u201cWe saw a pic yesterday where he took a chameleon and he splattered the chameleon,\u201d Israel said. \u201cThings like this, that\u2019s not normal behavior.\u201d The \u201cnikolascruzmakarov\u201d account (the Instagram handle appears to be a combination of the suspect\u2019s name, Nikolas Cruz, and \u201cMakarov,\u201d the name of a Russian semi-automatic pistol) does feature images of dead lizards:         A classmate also mentioned the dead lizard photographs on Cruz\u2019s Instagram feed in a statement to NBC News. ABC News also posted images from this account and reported that law enforcement sources had confirmed that it did indeed belong to the suspected shooter: According to Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, investigators have already found some \u201cdisturbing\u201d content on social media that could have provided warning signs. \u201cWe have already begun to dissect his websites and things on social media that he was on, and some of the things that have come to mind are very, very disturbing,\u201d Israel said. The photos posted on an Instagram account law enforcement sources tell ABC News belongs to the suspected shooter shows a young man displaying an arsenal of weapons. Images from this account were also compiled for a video from the Associated Press:  The claim that this account was made after the shooting in order to frame Cruz as a Donald Trump supporter can also be debunked. Before this account was deleted, several outlets took screenshots of the images on this Instagram page which included time stamps dating back months before the shooting. The following photograph from Fox News, for instance, includes a time stamp from July 2017:  Fox shared this image with the caption: \u201cA picture on Nikolas Cruz\u2019s Instagram page shows him holding a rifle. (Instagram).\u201d A classmate told the Daily Beast that Cruz frequently wore patriotic clothing and that he was spotted wearing at least one \u201cMAGA\u201d hat: \u201cI knew him to be passive aggressive but not violent. He was rude to people. He had an act up like he was tough. He never got into, like, physical fights with anyone, but he did get into verbal arguments,\u201d 17-year-old Ocean Parodie told The Daily Beast. \u201cI just thought he dropped out of school, I didn\u2019t think he would do anything. He always kept a low profile.\u201d [\u2026] Cruz always had his hair short and had a penchant for wearing patriotic shirts that \u201cseemed really extreme, like hating on\u201d Islam, Parodie said. The suspected gunman would also deride Muslims as \u201cterrorists and bombers.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen him wear a Trump hat,\u201d the student said. Regardless of what political party the Parkland mass shooter purported to support, a picture of his belief system is coming into focus: on 15 February 2018, the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks and monitors hate groups, issued a press release stating that he may have been affiliated with Republic of Florida, a white supremacist group. However, local law enforcement says that as yet there is no indication of any ties between Cruz and any paramilitary groups, including ROF. "
