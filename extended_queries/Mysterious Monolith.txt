    "claim": "Photographs show a metallic, nonnatural monolith that was discovered in Utah. ",
    "content": " In November 2020, photographs and videos supposedly showing a monolith that was discovered somewhere in Utah started to circulate on social media: While we don\u2019t know too much about what this object is or who put it there, this is a genuine image of a surprising discovery. This photograph was taken by the Utah Department of Public Safety Aero Bureau and was posted to their official social media pages on Nov. 20. The bureau explained that they discovered the monolith a few days before while conducting a count of big horn sheep in the area.  The Bureau wrote on Instagram: \u201cCounting big horn sheep with DWR this week. During the counts we came across this, in the middle of nowhere, buried deep in the rock. Inquiring minds want to know, what the heck is it? Anyone? \ud83d\udc7d?\u201d In a news release, the organization said that the discovery was made on Nov. 18 somewhere in southeastern Utah. The group did not want to give the exact location of the object, fearing that \u2014 since it was in an isolated area \u2014 it would lead to visitors who could potentially get lost and stranded. The object is made of metal and judging from the photographs it stands over 10 feet tall. While it\u2019s unclear who erected this monolith, the government agency noted that it was illegal \u201cto install structures or art without authorization on federally managed public lands, no matter what planet you\u2019re from.\u201d         Here\u2019s the full press release and some additional photographs of the monolith: On November 18, 2020, the Utah Department of Public Safety Aero Bureau was working with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources to conduct a count of big horn sheep in a portion of southeastern Utah. While on this mission, they spotted an unusual object and landed nearby to investigate further. The crew members found a metal monolith installed in the ground in a remote area of red rock. The crew said there was no obvious indication of who might have put the monolith there. The exact location of the installation is not being disclosed since it is in a very remote area and if individuals were to attempt to visit the area, there is a significant possibility they may become stranded and require rescue. It is illegal to install structures or art without authorization on federally managed public lands, no matter what planet you\u2019re from. The Bureau of Land Management will be determining if they need to investigate further.     While we can\u2019t say for certain where this monolith comes from, the most likely explanation is that it was some form of art installation. It\u2019s possible that it was undertaken in the same spirit as the crop circle hoaxes that popped up around England in the 1970s and convinced a generation of people that aliens were communicating via corn fields. A monolith is defined in the dictionary as a \u201cgreat stone often in the form of an obelisk or column,\u201d but this word has become closely associated with alien encounters, thanks in large part to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1968 film \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d In fact, the monolith that was discovered in Utah bares a resemblance to the alien monolith depicted in the film:      It should also be noted that although news of this mysterious monolith went viral in November 2020, imagery from Google Maps indicates that the odd artifact has been in its current location since at least 2015-16. Here are a few additional videos of this monolith from the Utah Department of Public Safety:          Shortly after these images went viral, it was reported that this mysterious monolith had \u201cdisappeared.\u201d But there was nothing otherworldly about its disappearance. USA Today reported that four humans removed the structure from the area. Monolith mania continued through the end of November as a similar structure was found in Romania.  As of this writing, the most likely explanation for these monoliths continues to be artists/bored humans.  "

    "claim": "A new mysterious \"monolith\" was found in California.",
    "content": " In the winter months of 2020, oblong metallic structures appeared and vanished in various locations, creating something of a public mystery \u2014 in part because the objects\u2019 appearance reminded some of the famous monolith in the 1968 science fiction film \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d After making a splash and appearing in Utah on Nov. 18, 2020, a monolith appeared in Romania less than two weeks later. Both mysteriously disappeared days after they were found. Then on Dec. 2, a third one was found on Pine Mountain in Atascadero, a city in central California\u2019s coastal San Luis Obispo County.  \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 BREAKING NEWS \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8  There is currently a monolith at the top of Pine Mountain in Atascadero!! (Photos by @Atownreporter) pic.twitter.com/0vPhEWYkeY \u2014 Connor Allen (@ConnorCAllen) December 2, 2020  According to the local newspaper, The Atascadero News, the monolith has become an attraction for hikers in the area: The three-sided obelisk appeared to be made of stainless steel, 10-feet tall and 18 inches wide. The object was welded together at each corner, with rivets attaching the side panels to a likely steel frame inside. The top of the monument did not show any weld marks, and it appears to be hollow at the top, and possibly bottom. Unlike its Utah sibling, the Atascadero obelisk was not attached to the ground, and could be knocked over with a firm push. The Atascadero News estimates it weighs about 200 pounds. As of this writing, there is no publicly-known explanation as to who is responsible for the objects or why they are appearing, although a working hypothesis is that they are part of a guerrilla art installation. Some joked that the monoliths were the work of extraterrestrials. The monolith was torn down overnight by a group of white supremacists decked out in gear labeled with the campaign slogan of U.S. President Donald Trump, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d as reported by Vice on Dec. 3, 2020. One of the men stated on a livestream video of their activity, \u201cChrist is king in this country. We don\u2019t want illegal aliens from Mexico or outer space.\u201d "

    "claim": "The Georgia Guidestones were stolen from their site and then re-erected in New Hampshire. ",
    "content": " In July 2017, NCScooper.com published two stories about the Georgia Guidestones, a mysterious granite monument constructed in the 1980s by an artist under a pseudonym, and inscribed with ten guidelines that are meant to provide humanity with a blueprint for the means to exist on the earth. Whether it is meant to re-establish order after a global apocalypse or is simply something toward which its creators wish humanity to collectively strive is unclear: Engraved in the stones are ten guidelines meant to re-establish the planet and society, perhaps after an apocalypse. They are written in eight different languages, English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese and Russian, and among other commandments preach to: \u2013 Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature. \u2013 Rule passion \u2013 faith \u2013 tradition \u2013 and all things with tempered reason. \u2013 Balance personal rights with social duties. \u2013 Be not a cancer on the earth \u2013 Leave room for nature. The guidestones also serve as an astronomical calendar, and every day at noon the sun shines through a narrow hole in the structure and illuminates the day\u2019s date on an engraving. The names of four ancient languages are inscribed on the sides near the top: Babylonian cuneiform, Classical Greek, Sanskrit, and Egyptian Hieroglyphics. Additionally an instructional tablet at the site speaks of a time capsule buried underneath the surface, though the dates on which the capsule was buried and when it is to be re-opened are missing. Whether this is intentional or the capsule was never buried is unknown. Naturally, the stones have been the focus of a whole string of conspiracy theories. These articles had little to do with the pre-existing conspiracy theories, however. The first reported that the giant granite slabs had been stolen, and the second article said that they reappeared in New Hampshire: The Georgia Guidestones, which is a mysterious granite monument erected in the early 1980s that contains a set of 10 guidelines in eight modern languages, has been stolen according to Elbert County Sheriff officials. What baffles investigators is how anyone one could have moved the 200 ton slabs without anyone noticing. \u201cSomeone or something came in late last night and took them,\u201d said Elbert County Sheriff Shayne Heap speaking in an early morning press conference. \u201cThose things are really heavy and it would take a large crew and heavy machinery to move them. We also have no motive in the crime, but there always has been a lot of mischief around the Stones.\u201d NCScooper.com is an entertainment web site that does not publish factual stories, and these stories are untrue and not meant to be taken seriously. The web site explains in its biting \u201cmanifesto\u201d that its content is satirical in nature and intended to be read as such:  First off, what kind of dolt reads a manifesto? Answer we do and apparently so do you. So congrats. The Scooper is a satirical website is in scope and intent. Sometimes it\u2019s funny; often it is not. in scope and intent. It provides social criticism in a satirical, sometimes news-genre setting. We are not a \u201cfake news\u201d site, but rather an entertainment one. Sometimes it\u2019s just plain-old crappy writing with a few bad jokes. Our intention is not to fool or trick anyone, but obviously it happens. We firmly believe that you can soften a person\u2019s willingness to listen by injecting irony, and yes sometimes humor, into the conversation. The Georgia Guidestones is a real (and unusual) monument that was commissioned by an anonymous group in the 1980s, contains a set of instructions for rebuilding humanity after doomsday that is written in several different languages, and functions as a clock, a calendar, and a compass: Approaching the edifice, it\u2019s hard not to think immediately of England\u2019s Stonehenge or possibly the ominous monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Built in 1980, these pale gray rocks are quietly awaiting the end of the world as we know it. Called the Georgia Guidestones, the monument is a mystery\u2014nobody knows exactly who commissioned it or why. The only clues to its origin are on a nearby plaque on the ground\u2014which gives the dimensions and explains a series of intricate notches and holes that correspond to the movements of the sun and stars\u2014and the \u201cguides\u201d themselves, directives carved into the rocks. These instructions appear in eight languages ranging from English to Swahili and reflect a peculiar New Age ideology. Some are vaguely eugenic (guide reproduction wisely\u2014improving fitness and diversity); others prescribe standard-issue hippie mysticism (prize truth\u2014beauty\u2014love\u2014seeking harmony with the infinite). What\u2019s most widely agreed upon\u2014based on the evidence available\u2014is that the Guidestones are meant to instruct the dazed survivors of some impending apocalypse as they attempt to reconstitute civilization. Although, as mentioned, these odd guidestones are often the subjects of conspiracy theories, the claims that they were stolen and then moved to New Hampshire originated from a satire page. "
