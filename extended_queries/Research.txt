    "claim": "A law in Iowa forbids people from kissing for more than five minutes.",
    "content": " The claim that Iowans are legally prohibited from kissing for more than five minutes has been circulating on the internet for more than a decade. While this \u201cdumb law\u201d has been reported by dozens of web sites, it appears to have originated on a joke web site and not with any actual legislation. This is frequently shared on social media and has appeared on web sites such as Only In Your State, news outlets such as My San Antonio, and books such as The Duh Awards: In This Stupid World, We Take the Prize. While this \u201cdumb law\u201d has been shared far and wide on the internet, the majority of these outlets fail to provide any evidence that this law actually exists; when a web site does provide a source link, it is typically directed at the web site Dumblaws.com: Kisses may last for no more than five minutes. While Dumblaws.com does provide the \u201cfull text of the law\u201d for many of its items, several laws (including Iowa\u2019s alleged kissing law) are presented without proof. This isn\u2019t surprising, as Dumblaws.com writes in its FAQ section that the web site is for \u201centertainment only\u201d and that the laws appearing on the site have not been properly fact-checked: We have done our best to maintain the accuracy of this database, however, we are not lawyers and do not have the time nor resources to explore the topic as thoroughly as we would like. If you have information that conflicts with ours, please let me know! For those who like fine print: I make no representation, expressed or implied, regarding the accuracy of the material posted on this web site. It is for entertainment only, and you should do your own research before using this information for any purpose The earliest mention of this law that we could uncover appeared on a humor web site in 1998. While \u201cJames Fuqua\u2019s Law Jokes\u201d does offer a few citations, the listing for Iowa\u2019s kissing law is \u2014 once again \u2014 presented without evidence. Our search of the Iowa Legislature also came up empty handed. While we found dozens of laws related to kissing, largely connected to sexual assault or child abuse, we found no record of Iowa legally limiting the length of a kiss.  At any rate, it seems that it would be a difficult law to enforce. "

    "claim": "Bill Gates is being sued by India over the deaths of girls resulting from vaccinations.",
    "content": " As governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Read our coronavirus fact checks. Submit any questionable rumors and \u201cadvice\u201d you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.   During the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020, a popular social media meme asserted that philanthropist Bill Gates was partnered with business magnate George Soros in owning a lab in Wuhan, China (the presumed location where the COVID-19 outbreak originated), and was being sued by India over the deaths of girls resulting from vaccinations:  It is true that the Microsoft co-founder, through his Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, has expended billions of dollars funding research and childhood-immunization programs in developing countries. Gates, who has long warned that we are inadequately prepared to deal with global pandemics, has also pledged to make billions of dollars available for funding the manufacture of vaccines to combat the novel coronavirus. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was a member of the Leadership Council for the Gates Foundation\u2019s Decade of Vaccines Collaboration effort launched in 2010. However, the meme jumps the rails at suggesting anything more than that Gates is interested in improving lives through medical research and vaccinations. Gates does not own a lab in Wuhan, China, in partnership with Soros; that claim is a combination of two separate and false rumors that we have already debunked at length: that the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was deliberately engineered as a bioweapon, and that Soros owns the laboratory in Wuhan where the alleged development of the virus supposedly took place. The rumor that \u201cIndia is suing Bill Gates because he vaccinated 77,000 third world girls between the ages of 9 &amp; 15 and many of them died\u201d is also a false one that we have explored at length. This claim is not directly connected to Gates or the Gates Foundation, but rather to the global health organization PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health), which conducted a study beginning in 2009 to see if it could reduce the number of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections by providing cost-effective vaccines to impoverished communities. (The Gates Foundation was one of PATH\u2019s global partners and reportedly provided funding for its HPV study.) The study caused controversy in India when seven of the girls involved in the trial in that country died after receiving their vaccines, but state investigations found those deaths were unrelated to the vaccinations: State investigations absolved the trial\u2019s managers \u2014 PATH and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in New Delhi \u2014 of responsibility in the deaths. Five were evidently unrelated to the vaccine: One girl drowned in a quarry; another died from a snake bite; two committed suicide by ingesting pesticides; and one died from complications of malaria. The causes of death for the other two girls were less certain: one possibly from pyrexia, or high fever, and a second from a suspected cerebral hemorrhage. Government investigators concluded that pyrexia was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to be related to the vaccine, and likewise they considered a link between stroke and the vaccine as \u201cunlikely.\u201d ICMR\u2019s director general, microbiologist Vishwa Mohan Katoch, categorically rejects a connection: \u201cBased on the enquiry, it is certain that causality of the seven deaths was not at all related to the HPV vaccine,\u201d he insists. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) suspended PATH\u2019s HPV clinical trial in India over irregularities such as improperly obtained consent forms, and the Union Government issued a warning letter to PATH \u201casking it to be careful while conducting clinical trials so as to ensure that discrepancies and violations are not repeated in future.\u201d But neither that global health organization nor the Gates Foundation is being \u201csued\u201d by India or has been \u201cbanned\u201d from operating in that country.

    "claim": "An American diplomat named Melanie Honcharenko was found dead shortly before testifying in the impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump. ",
    "content": " On Dec. 4, 2019, the White House Insider published an article claiming that \u201cAmerican diplomat Melanie Honcharenko\u201d was found dead in her home shortly before testifying in the impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump: American Diplomat Melanie Honcharenko was discovered dead in her North Potomac, MD home early Wednesday morning. No details are known at the moment; Maryland authorities have yet to make a statement of any kind.  What is known is that Honcharenko has played an active diplomatic role in Ukraine since 2016, and was an active participant in a number of the incidents described by the witnesses in the Impeachment proceedings of President Donald Trump, and was set to be deposed behind closed doors sometime next week due to the classified nature of her work in Ukraine. This is not a genuine news article, and an American diplomat by that name was not found dead in her home shortly before testifying in the impeachment inquiry into Trump.  First, we were unable to find any record of an American diplomat by this name. In fact, we were unable to find any person with this name prior to the publication of White House Insider article. Furthermore, a woman by the name Melanie Honcharenko was never scheduled to deliver testimony during the impeachment inquiry into Trump. The House Intelligence Committee announced the witnesses who would publicly testify in November 2019. The witnesses scheduled to appear before the House Judiciary Committee were announced in early December 2019. The name \u201cHoncharenko\u201d appeared on no lists.  We also performed a reverse-image search on the photograph that White House Insider claimed showed Honcharenko. We found that the person featured in this image was actually a professor at the University of Alberta named Alla Nedashkivska.  In short, the White House Insider article took a photograph of an unrelated woman, invented the name of American diplomat, and then claimed without evidence that she was found dead in her home before testifying in Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry.

    "claim": "A photograph shows U.S. President Bill Clinton with billionaire/financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. ",
    "content": " On July 10, 2019, we examined a claim holding that Google was \u201cscrubbing\u201d its search results of any pictures showing President Bill Clinton together with convicted sex offender and billionaire/financier Jeffrey Epstein. While this rumor was false (Google\u2019s search results were not notably different than those of Yahoo, Duck Duck Go, Yandex, or Bing), we were left with one unanswered question: Are there any photos of Epstein and Clinton? After all, Clinton flew on the private plane of Epstein, a convicted sex offender who was arrested again in July 2019 on new charges related to child-sex-prostitution. The two were also both present at a \u201csmall dinner party\u201d in 1995 hosted by Revlon mogul Ron Perelman to raise funds for the Democratic National Convention. It seems reasonable to believe that someone at some point took a photograph of these two well-known public figures together.  On July 22, 2019, Josh Rosner, the managing director of independent research consultancy Graham Fisher &amp; Co, alerted us to his tweet containing a photograph of Epstein and Clinton that was published in a 2003 issue of Vanity Fair:  Disturbing! The #press wiped all pictures of \u2066@BillClinton\u2069 &amp; #JeffreyEpstein from the #internet. Even \u2066@VanityFair\u2069 who published this image in \u201803 from their #sex(?) trip to Brunei scrubbed it. #sycophant #power \u2066@CJR\u2069 \u2066@theintercept\u2069 \u2066@propublica\u2069 pic.twitter.com/MmCZZraHai \u2014 joshua rosner (@JoshRosner) July 22, 2019          Again, no evidence exists that this image was \u201cwiped\u201d from the Internet. In fact, this image is available online in Vanity Fair\u2019s digital archive (subscription required). This photograph was published in a March 2003 article by Vicky Ward entitled, \u201cThe Talented Mr. Epstein.\u201d The photograph\u2019s caption: \u201cEpstein with President Clinton in Brunei, 2002.\u201d  One possible explanation as to why this photograph doesn\u2019t pop up in search engines is that Vanity Fair didn\u2019t publish it as a standalone image. Rather, it is embedded in a digital copy of the March 2003 edition of the magazine. While we\u2019re not in the business of offering predictions, we\u2019d bet that this image will start finding its way into Google Images and other image-based search engines in the near future (especially if more outlets pick up and publish stories including this image). Clinton is mentioned three other times in the Vanity Fair story; each iteration is reproduced below (emphasis ours): Lately, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s high-flying style has been drawing oohs and aahs: the bachelor financier lives in New York\u2019s largest private residence, claims to take only billionaires as clients, and flies celebrities including Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey on his Boeing 727. But pierce his air of mystery and the picture changes. VICKY WARD explores Epstein\u2019s investment career, his ties to retail magnate Leslie Wexner, and his complicated past.  In addition to the town house, Epstein lives in what is reputed to be the largest private dwelling in New Mexico, on an $18 million, 7,500-acre ranch which he named \u201cZorro.\u201d \u201cIt makes the town house look like a shack,\u201d Epstein has said. He also owns Little St. James, a 70-acre island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the main house is currently being renovated by Edward Tuttle, a designer of the Aman resorts. There is also a $6.8 million house in Palm Beach, Florida, and a fleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and a Boeing 727, replete with trading room, on which Epstein recently flew President Clinton, actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, Lew Wasserman\u2019s grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few others, on a mission to explore the problems of AIDS and economic development in Africa.  Epstein is known about town as a man who loves women\u2014lots of them, mostly young. Model types have been heard saying they are full of gratitude to Epstein for flying them around, and he is a familiar face to many of the Victoria\u2019s Secret girls. One young woman recalls being summoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to a concert at Epstein\u2019s town house, where the women seemed to outnumber the men by far. \u201cThese were not women you\u2019d see at Upper East Side dinners,\u201d the woman recalls. \u201cMany seemed foreign and dressed a little bizarrely.\u201d This same guest also attended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell that Prince Andrew attended, which was filled, she says, with young Russian models. \u201cSome of the guests were horrified,\u201d the woman says. \u201cHe\u2019s reckless,\u201d says a former business associate, \u201cand he\u2019s gotten more so. Money does that to you. He\u2019s breaking the oath he made to himself\u2014that he would never do anything that would expose him in the media. Right now, in the wake of the publicity following his trip with Clinton, he must be in a very difficult place.\u201d In 2002, around the time that this photograph was taken, Clinton told New York Magazine via a spokesperson that, \u201cJeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science. I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service and combating H.I.V./AIDS.\u201d Clinton once had a relationship with Epstein and even took multiple trips on his private plane. However, the former president said that he hasn\u2019t had contact with Epstein for a decade and knows nothing about the crimes the latter has been accused or convicted of:  Statement on Jeffrey Epstein. pic.twitter.com/98ha9YYd1l \u2014 Angel Ure\u00f1a (@angelurena) July 8, 2019  Clinton, of course, isn\u2019t the only high-profile politician connected to Epstein. U.S. President Donald Trump has also been photographed with Epstein.  "

The study also shows that thin women tend to be more reserved, more unfriendly and less expressive with their emotions. The Argentinian newspaper Nuevo Diario reports on the findings from the research conducted by Dr Filem\u00f3n Alvarado and Dr Edgardo Morales at UNAM\u2019s department of psychology. According to their research, chubby women make their men ten times as happy as thin women. And we all know that happy people live longer. The study also indicated that chubby women are better at anticipating their partner\u2019s needs.  In terms of science journalism, a number of red flags were apparent right off the bat. The easiest to spot would be the fact that not a single news report on this topic provided a link to the \u201cnew study\u201d it referenced. Second, and perhaps more damning, is the fact that a quick Google Scholar search provides no evidence that anybody named Filem\u00f3n Alvarado or Edgardo Morales ever published anything remotely approaching this topic over at least the past two years. Third, a regular Google search on their names provides only links related to this one viral story. Additionally, the web site of the psychology department at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (option one for UNAM) does not list someone by either name as a faculty member,  and the web site for the National University of Misiones in Argentina (option two for UNAM) provides no evidence that the school has a psychology department at all. The final documentable red flag is the fact that the alleged study (a thesis reportedly titled \u201cVale m\u00e1s que sobre y que no falte\u201d) does not turn up in a search of either institutions\u2019 web sites. While we are not rating the claims of the study itself, we are rating its existence as unproven for the above reasons. We have reached out to both UNAMs and will update if either institution is able clarify the confusion. "

    "claim": "An inattentive janitor caused several deaths in a hospital when he disconnected patients' life support systems to plug in a floor polisher.",
    "content": " The 1990s saw the spread of a shocking account of tragic, accidental deaths in the very place where people are supposed to recover from their illnesses \u2014 a hospital:   [Collected on the Internet, 1996] \u201cFor several months, our nurses have been baffled to find a dead patient in the same bed every Friday morning,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Pelonomi Hospital (Free State, South Africa) told reporters. \u201cThere was no apparent cause for any of the deaths, and extensive checks on the air conditioning system, and a search for possible bacterial infection, failed to reveal any clues.\u201d \u201cHowever, further inquiries have now revealed the cause of these deaths. It seems that every Friday morning a cleaner would enter the ward, remove the plug that powered the patient\u2019s life support system, plug her floor polisher into the vacant socket, then go about her business. When she had finished her chores, she would plug the life support machine back in and leave, unaware that the patient was now dead. She could not, after all, hear the screams and eventual death rattle over the whirring of her polisher.\u201d \u201cWe are sorry, and have sent a strong letter to the cleaner in question. Further, the Free State Health and Welfare Department is arranging for an electrician to fit an extra socket, so there should be no repetition of this incident. The enquiry is now closed.\u201d    [Collected on the Internet, 2003] There was a case in one hospital\u2019s Intensive Care ward where patients always died in the same bed, on Sunday morning at 11 A.M., regardless of their medical condition. This puzzled the doctors and some even thought that it had something to do with the supernatural. No one could solve the mystery as to why the deaths occurred around 11 A. M. on Sundays. So, a Worldwide team of experts was assembled to investigate the cause of the incidents. The next Sunday morning, a few minutes before 11 A. M., all the doctors and nurses nervously wait outside the ward to see for themselves what the terrible phenomenon was all about. Some were holding wooden crosses, prayer books and other holy objects to ward off the evil spirits. Just when the clock struck 11\u2026 Pookie Johnson, The part-time Sunday sweeper, entered the ward and unplugged the life support system so that he could use the vacuum cleaner.  If nothing else, the bit about the hospital\u2019s sending a sharply-worded letter to the cleaning company who employee was responsible for multiple deaths should give one pause. Was ensuring that the janitor was reprimanded by his employer really the hospital\u2019s greatest concern? Oftentimes it\u2019s the tail ends of these stories which make the difference between cute ones which get told once or twice then drop out of sight, and ones such as this, which get forwarded all over the world. The floor cleaner\u2019s mistake is bad enough; what sends this story over the top is the callous matter-of-factness of the hospital. What does it say about health care in South Africa? Summer 1996 saw this hilarious yet chilling account take the Internet by storm.  In an article purportedly from the 13 June 1996 Cape Times (\u201cCleaner Polishes Off Patients\u201d), it quickly became the story of the moment. Various publications picked it up and ran it as a news item, adding to the legend\u2019s credibility.         Bottom line: no matter how many papers you might have read that said different, there were no Friday massacres in Pelonomi Hospital, no murdering floor cleaners, no overly-callous hospital spokespeople imperiously intoning, \u201cThe enquiry is now closed.\u201d It\u2019s folklore, pure and simple \u2014 a tall tale that got loose, then went on a rampage. How did this amazing story come to be taken as a news item? As always, through a misunderstanding. The legend had been around forever, so Die Volksblad (a small yet widely-circulated rural South African newspaper) took it upon itself to get to the bottom of this persistent rumor. Part of that effort to uncover the truth resulted in a Die Volksblad article asking those related to the victim(s) to come forward. That article was picked up by Die Burger, and it was Die Burger\u2019s article which Cape Times got its hands on. In much the same way children playing a game of \u201cTelephone\u201d will invariably garble the message, Cape Times\u2018 version came out as a news story, not as a rural paper\u2019s attempt to sort fact from fiction.  From there the tale went to other publications, very few of whom bothered to check either with Pelonomi hospital or Die Volksblad.  Those journalists who checked with Cape Times (and not all of them did even this much) were told that yes, it had run a story about this. Unknown both to the reporters doing the asking and Cape Times personnel doing the answering, the version made popular by the Internet and the actual Cape Times article weren\u2019t the same. The Internet version had been greatly embellished, further garbling the already hopelessly garbled and creating by the stroke of a few electrons a suitably cold-hearted but entirely fictional spokeswoman for Pelonomi Hospital. From there on in, it became a zoo, with publications such as New Scientist and the Sunday Telegraph claiming this as a news item. And why not indeed? Cape Times was telling them it was. South African folklorist Arthur Goldstuck was involved with this tale almost from the moment it appeared. His fascinating \u201cCleaner Polishes Off Patient\u201d FAQ is filled with an incredible depth of detail about this legend. Although the \u201cmurdering South African floor cleaner\u201d tale was new in 1996, its basic plot was as old as the hills, as demonstrated by this anecdote from a 1967 issue of Reader\u2019s Digest:  British engineers feared that they would have to replan the Dungesness nuclear station in Kent, after studying a special model which showed the flow of rivers and estuaries in the area. Then they discovered the reason for the puzzling variations in the model\u2019s water level. An office cleaner had been filling her bucket from it each day.         Once again, a dull-witted office cleaner is said to have upset Technology\u2019s applecart while discharging her janitorial duties. The charwoman does not recognize the \u201cspecial model\u201d serves a particular purpose \u2014 she views it merely as something she can fill her bucket from and uses it as such. Likewise, the South African floor cleaner perceives the loaded outlet in Intensive Care only as a place to plug in a needed piece of cleaning equipment \u2014 recognition that whatever is already occupying that outlet might be important eludes him. The theme of both these stories appears in another tale collected in 1993, this one poking fun not at office cleaners, but at office workers.   Around noon every day the computer system at some office keeps freezing out.  Five minutes later the system will power back up again.  No one can figure out what\u2019s going on \u2014 software checks out, hardware checks out, everything is as protected as it can be from a power surge, and besides, why would there be a power surge every day around the same time?   Finally, one bright whiz kid decides to keep an eye on the main server as the only thing that makes sense is someone has to be fooling with it. Sure enough, a little after noon one of the secretaries comes by with a kettle in hand, reaches down, unplugs the server \u2026  An additional thread ties all of these stories together. It\u2019s no accident these legends are told about janitors and secretaries: they are considered lesser beings in the world of labor and are often presumed to be of lower intelligence. In each of these tales, someone from the bottom rungs of the corporate ladder who has access to key equipment but lacks so much as a basic understanding of its function and importance screws the pooch. Such tales confirm the commonly-held stereotypes of those who hold those jobs. Given how prevalent similar tales are, there was very little excuse for the journalistic outpouring the South African floor cleaner story provoked in 1996. (One need not hear a joke told the same way each time to recognize it as the same joke, after all.) This mess proved so very conclusively that even newspapermen fall victim to \u2018I read it in the paper, so it must be true.\u201d  Sightings:   This legend figures in an episode of the British police drama A Touch of Frost (\u201cBenefit of the Doubt,\u201d original air date 15 January 2001).

    "content": " On 25 August 2017, WND reported that the San Domenico independent Catholic school in San Anselmo, California had removed dozens of statues of Catholic and Christian figures, including Christ, from the school\u2019s campus: Parents of students at a Catholic school in the San Francisco Bay area are protesting the board\u2019s decision to remove and relocate more than 160 statues of Jesus, Mary and historic church figures from the campus in an effort to make the school more \u201cinclusive.\u201d The story extensively cites an earlier article published by a local newspaper, the Marin Independent Journal, which quotes some parents and community members as being concerned about the removal of the statues, as well as school officials and board members defending it.  On 26 August 2017, conservative site BizPac Review followed up with its own report, writing: Holy mother of Jesus, what is going on in America? An independent Catholic school in the San Francisco Bay Area \u2014 where else? \u2014 has removed a statue of Mary and Baby Jesus from its campus in an attempt to be more \u201cinclusive.\u201d A number of statues and Catholic icons have been removed from the campus of San Domenico School in San Anselmo, the Marin Independent Journal reported. A move that is part of a \u201cnew strategic plan\u201d to appeal to more potential students.         It\u2019s true that San Domenico has been removing Catholic statues from its campus, and that this has been part of an ongoing effort to be more inclusive and appeal to non-Catholic prospective students. However, while reports do mention the fact that San Domenico is an independent Catholic school, they don\u2019t clearly explain what this means for the school\u2019s ethos and strategic planning, and why the decision to remove the statues is a good deal less surprising when San Domenico\u2019s status as an independent Catholic school (as opposed to a Diocesan Catholic school) is taken into consideration.  A spokesperson for San Domenico told us that the school had removed six out of sixteen statues from campus, leaving ten. WND\u2019s claim that the school had removed \u201cmore than 160 statues\u201d is therefore false by a wide margin. School authorities also recently moved a statue of Saint Dominic \u2014 the school\u2019s patron saint \u2014 to a more prominent place on campus and added a plaque to honor him.  The San Domenico school was founded in 1850 as an independent Catholic school by the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael. In 1965, it became an independent nonprofit organization. It is not a Diocesan school, which means it has never been under the control of the Catholic church hierarchy. Diocesan Catholic schools are owned and run by local Catholic archdioceses (regional divisions of the church throughout the United States and the rest of the world). They therefore form part of the church hierarchy which ultimately extends upwards to the Vatican.  San Domenico school (like other independent Catholic schools) exists outside this realm, and therefore has independence in balancing its Dominican Catholic heritage and ethos with its emphasis on cultural and religious inclusivity and diversity. One manifestation of this difference is that students at diocesan schools are generally taught Catholic dogma, while students at schools like San Domenico are not; instead, they receive instruction in \u201creligious studies\u201d. In the lower school, this curriculum is known as \u201creligious studies and character development\u201d. Students are taught to develop a \u201cmoral framework for making ethical decisions which guide personal choices and interpersonal relationships.\u201d In the middle school, this means pupils study the Bible, Quran, Buddhism and do comparative research on major world religions. In the upper school, students are offered classes in global studies, philosophy, the history of Christianity, and Zen Buddhism, among others.  The school is run by a Board of Trustees. In 2016, just three of the board\u2019s 26 members were from the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael. A spokesperson for the school told us that approximately 80 percent of the school\u2019s parents and students do not identify as Catholic. In June 2016, the Board of Trustees approved a new strategic plan for the school. The second of its five main goals was: \u201cStrengthen San Domenico\u2019s identity as an Independent School and clearly articulate our inclusive spiritual foundation.\u201d There is historical context for this effort, according to the strategic plan (page 8): The Dominican Sisters of San Rafael, who have been trailblazers in facilitating education, providing healthcare, seeking social justice, and addressing serious environmental issues, founded San Domenico as an Independent School committed to inclusivity, inquiry and character-driven education. \u2026In addition to being an Independent School, San Domenico is a Dominican School, which means that we express our religious identity through the charism of the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael. Their motto of Veritas, the search for truth, their focus on social justice and environmental stewardship, and their educational philosophy grounded in both inclusivity and a spirit of inquiry, provides the foundation for our unique approach to spiritual education and the study of world religions.  Finally, it should be noted that the decision to remove some Catholic statues from public visibility on San Domenico\u2019s campus does not appear to have come from any external pressure or the implacable forces of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. It\u2019s a step that school authorities themselves have chosen as part of San Domenico\u2019s evolution, and it is fully in keeping with the school\u2019s stated philosophy of inclusivity and diversity.

    "claim": "The Trump Administration\u2019s policies have halted a research effort seeking a cure for HIV.",
    "content": " In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that they would be canceling a contract with a company called Advanced Bioscience Resources Inc. (ABR) to procure fetal tissue for federal medical research projects. The department alleged that they were not \u201csufficiently assured that the contract included the appropriate protections applicable to fetal tissue research or met all other procurement requirements.\u201d Using this development as pretext, HHS announced that they would additionally be conducting \u201ca comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue to ensure consistency with statutes and regulations governing such research, and to ensure the adequacy of procedures and oversight of this research in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved\u201d \u2014 in effect putting a \u201cpause\u201d on all research that relied on fetal tissue. ABR supplied fetal tissue to two National Institutes of Health [NIH] laboratories, one of which uses the material to create what are known as humanized mice. In a broad sense, these mice have been bred, with the help of fetal human tissue, to express a human immune response, making them a cost-effective way to test the efficacy of immunotherapeutic drugs:  Such mice are particularly valuable for HIV drug testing in part because tissue from a single human fetus can readily generate a group of 40 to 50 genetically identical mice, and because the animals can, unlike monkeys, be infected with the human virus, HIV. Potential drugs can then be tested in such a group, with ample mice as controls, giving the studies robust statistical power.  ABR had been the supplier of fetal tissue to NIH\u2019s Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Montana, which had been using humanized mice to test potential HIV therapies. In a grant report on that laboratory\u2019s efforts to study HIV using humanized-mouse models during the 2016 fiscal year, NIH scientist Kim Hasenkrug indicated strong potential for their research methods to aid in the search for new treatments for HIV:  Experiments in FY2016 revealed that our \u2026 humanized mouse model can be used in long-term studies (up to one year) with [Antiretroviral Therapy, ART] administered by injections or via an oral route (drugs incorporated into mouse chow). Such mice develop chronic and latent HIV infections. We have demonstrated that HIV viral loads in these mice can be suppressed to levels undetectable by highly sensitive PCR tests for viremia and provirus.          Warner Greene, the director of the Gladstone Center for HIV Cure Research in San Francisco, had been collaborating with RML to test potential antibody therapies on humanized mice, and he first told Science that the HHS \u201cpause\u201d on fetal tissue procurement meant that the researchers could not guarantee enough mice to complete a statistically robust study. In a phone call, he explained to us that:  What happened in September was that my NIH collaborator at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories [Kim Hasenkrug] was informed that he could no longer order fetal tissue from the sole source supplier, ABR, and so we [were told that we] could complete the [initial] experiment that [had already been set up], but in science you need to do multiple experiments. You can\u2019t depend upon one experiment to see whether it\u2019s repeatable, etc. So essentially this ban on fetal tissue stopped the line of investigation.  Speaking to Science, Greene said that \u201cHasenkrug had not yet launched the experiment, and [RML\u2019s] supplies of existing mice were too small to conduct the repeated experiments required to reach convincing scientific conclusions.\u201d In a 9 December 2018 statement provided to Science after the publication\u2019s original 7 December 2018 reporting, HHS acknowledged that they had (at least temporarily) blocked staff scientists from procuring fetal tissue, but that they did not think \u2014 or realize \u2014 such a move would have affected the study in question:  [In their statement, the NIH] said the agency in September \u201cput a pause in place\u201d for staff scientists procuring new human fetal tissue, \u201can action NIH thought was prudent given the examination of these procurements. Research with tissue already on hand could proceed, and NIH leaders asked to be notified by intramural investigators if new procurement would be necessary. NIH leadership was not informed that new procurement was necessary for the study you reference in your [7 December 2018 Science story]. We are looking into why this did not occur.\u201d  In his interview with us, Greene stated that this explanation made no sense. \u201cTo my knowledge \u2026 we were never made aware that we should approach the NIH to inform them of our need for more fetal tissue to complete this investigation.\u201d If such a request were required, Greene said, he and his team would have \u201cacted upon it in a millisecond.\u201d We also reached out to the director of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which oversees the Rocky Mountain Laboratory) for an update on the current status of the project and for clarification on the fetal tissue review\u2019s impact on the study but have not received a response. However, as HHS has acknowledged both that they \u201cput a pause in place\u201d on fetal tissue procurement, and that this pause resulted in the inability of a trial seeking an HIV cure to move forward, it is factual to state that the Trump administration\u2019s policies shut down (at least temporarily) scientists\u2019 efforts to find a cure for HIV. Greene told us that NIH has been extremely supportive of their work, and that he feels that this change is \u201cclearly a policy that\u2019s \u2026 reflective of a new political situation in Washington, D.C., that\u2019s now impacting our science.\u201d Greene is one of many who viewed the 24 September announcement regarding fetal tissue research as a proxy debate over abortion. Chronologically, the announcement that the federal government would cut ties with ABR followed a campaign by several anti-abortion groups who explicitly sought to have the government cancel its contract with ABR, as reported in Science:  On 11 September, 45 anti-abortion groups wrote to HHS Secretary Alex Azar that they were \u201cshocked and dismayed\u201d by the FDA contract [with ABR]. On 17 September, 85 members of Congress wrote a similar letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb asking him to cancel the contract. Reacting to HHS\u2019s actions [on 24 September], Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said: \u201cMy instinct is that this is driven by politics, and is part of the overall effort to stigmatize and eventually criminalize abortion, as well as part of a larger campaign to roll back the clock on sexual and reproductive rights.\u201d  Greene told us that after much internal debate, he and Hasenkrug plan on running that initial experiment anyway, with the hopes that the political climate will change in their favor come January 2019.

    "claim": "A November 2020 study found that vegetarian and vegan diets can put people at higher risk for either total or site-specific bone fractures. ",
    "content": " A study published on Nov. 23, 2020, found that non-meat eaters, especially vegans, were at higher risk of experiencing bone fractures. The study was published in the BMC Medicine journal and was conducted by the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition\u2019s (EPIC) Oxford University cohort. According to the study, previous research showed vegetarians had lower bone mineral density (BMD) \u2014 a measure of the amount of minerals contained in a certain volume of bone, also known as bone mass \u2014 than non-vegetarians, but associating vegetarian diets with fracture risks was unclear. Nearly 55,000 men and women across the United Kingdom responded to questionnaires in the beginning of the study between 1993 and 2001, and again in 2010. Respondents were categorized as meat eaters, fish eaters (did not eat meat but ate fish), vegetarians (did not eat meat or fish, but ate one or both of dairy and eggs), and vegans (participants who did not eat meat, fish, dairy, or eggs). The study concluded: Overall, we found that compared with meat eaters, vegans had higher risks of total, hip, leg, and vertebral fractures, while fish eaters and vegetarians had a higher risk of hip fractures. These risk differences were likely partly due to their lower BMI (Body Mass Index), and possibly to lower intakes of calcium and protein. We should note that there were several caveats. The study stated that \u201cbone health in vegans requires further research,\u201d and the study authors were operating with some limitations: More studies are needed especially from non-European and contemporary populations to examine the generalisability of our findings and to explore possible heterogeneity by factors including age, sex, menopausal status, and BMI. Nutrient intake was also self-reported by the participants instead of measured by the researchers, which could sometimes make the data less reliable. One potential concern they identified was the ability to capture all fracture cases: \u201cThe outcome data were ascertained based on hospital records, which reduced misreporting and selective loss to follow-up, although a possible limitation of this approach was that less serious fractures that did not require hospitalisation would not have been captured.\u201d Based on the results of this one study and its caveats, we can state that this claim is a mixture of truth and falsehood.

    "claim": "A video documents search engine Google manipulating results in favor of Hillary Clinton.",
    "content": " On 9 June 2016, the Youtube news channel SourceFed published a video in which they accused search engine giant Google of manipulating results in favor of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton: While researching for a wrap-up on the June 7 Presidential Primaries, we discovered evidence that Google may be manipulating autocomplete recommendations in favor of Hillary Clinton. If true, this would mean that Google Searches aren\u2019t objectively reflecting what the majority of Internet searches are actually looking for, possibly violating Google\u2019s algorithm. According to a research paper cited in this video, that kind of search result manipulation has the potential to substantially influence the outcome of actual elections.   While the claims posited in the video displayed above may sound like the workings of a conspiracy theorist, SourceFed didn\u2019t fudge any of its evidence. We double checked the videos findings and confirmed that Google does return different results than Bing and Yahoo for searches such as \u201cHillary Clinton Cri\u201d and \u201cHillary Clinton Ind.\u201d For instance, Google completes the search \u201cHillary Clinton Cri\u201d as \u201cHillary Clinton Crime Reform\u201d, while Bing and Yahoo complete the search as \u201cHillary Clinton Criminal Charges\u201d and \u201cHillary Clinton Criminal.\u201d Google provides this result despite the fact that \u201cHillary Clinton Crime Reform\u201d is a less popular term on Google Trends. However, that does not mean that Google is manipulating search results in favor of the Democratic presidential candidate. Google\u2019s autocomplete function uses a variety of factors, including the popularity of a search term, to determine results. Furthermore, Google has also said in statements that its autocomplete does not provide offensive or disparaging results when partnered with a person\u2019s name: Google Autocomplete does not favor any candidate or cause. Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how Autocomplete works. Our Autocomplete algorithm will not show a predicted query that is offensive or disparaging when displayed in conjunction with a person\u2019s name. More generally, our autocomplete predictions are produced based on a number of factors including the popularity of search terms.         While it\u2019s true that Google Autocomplete will not show \u201cHillary Clinton Criminal\u201d when searching for \u201cHillary Clinton Cri,\u201d we couldn\u2019t get Google Autocomplete to label anyone a criminal. When we searched for the names of various criminals along with the prefix \u201ccri,\u201d we received results for \u201ccricket,\u201d \u201ccriminology,\u201d \u201ccrisis communication,\u201d and in the case of recently convicted swimmer Brock Turner, no results:  Google\u2019s search results also differ than Bing and Yahoo\u2019s when searching for disparaging remarks against other political candidates, such as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. For instance, when searching for \u201cBernie Sanders Com\u201d on Google, you\u2019ll get results for \u201cBernie Sanders commercial,\u201d while Bing and Yahoo provide results related to communism. \u201cDonald Trump sex\u201d resulted in results about sexist remarks and sex scandals on Bing and Yahoo, while Google returned \u201cDonald Trump Sex And The City\u201d:   While Google does offer different search results than its competitors Bing and Yahoo, this is not proof that the search engine is skewing its results in favor of Hillary Clinton \u2014 or anybody else.
