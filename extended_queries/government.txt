    "claim": "The Obama administration gave 2,500 Iranians citizenship as part of nuclear deal negotiations.",
    "content": " On 3 July 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump repeated via Twitter a story that had been offered by Fox News one day earlier, holding that the administration of Trump\u2019s predecessor Barack Obama had granted U.S. citizenship to 2,500 Iranians during nuclear deal negotiations in 2015:  Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians \u2013 including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2018  The Obama administration negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal struck with Iran that lifted key sanctions against that country in exchange for Iran\u2019s allowing independent monitoring to ensure they were winding down their nuclear program. That plan was signed off on by all members of the United Nations Security Council, but in May 2018 President Trump abruptly backed the U.S. out of the agreement: The claim echoed by Trump in his tweet about \u201c2,500 Iranians\u201d was initially made by Iranian politician Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour and was quoted by Fars, a Persian-language news outlet with questionable reliability which is often described as a quasi-mouthpiece for the Iranian government. Fox News repeated that quote in their version of the report:  \u201cWhen Obama, during the negotiations about the [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIf today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.\u201d The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s inner circle, added: \u201cIt should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.\u201d         It\u2019s unclear where Zolnour, who is a critic of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and is considered a conservative hardliner, came up with the 2,500 figure (nor did the Fox News story provide any additional information on that front).  The Fox article also referenced the names of two relatives of Iranian officials who now live in the United States (Ali Fereydoun and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijanibut) but also noted that \u201cThere is no suggestion either of these people received citizenship in the wake of the Iranian nuclear deal.\u201d  According to Department of Homeland Security data, 10,344 Iranian-born persons became naturalized citizens of the U.S. in 2015, while 13,114 others gained legal permanent residency. Those numbers don\u2019t deviate drastically from preceding years\u2019 figures or from those of 2016, the most recent data available. Jeffrey Prescott, a senior director on President Obama\u2019s National Security Council, responded to the claim with a tweet labeling President Trump\u2019s statement as \u201cabsurd and false\u201d:  This an absurd and false allegation. It shouldn\u2019t be lost on anyone that this is a case of Donald Trump parroting Fox News, which is peddling the claims of an Iranian hardliner. https://t.co/AUacWXLmmC \u2014 Jeffrey Prescott (@jeffreyprescott) July 3, 2018  The comment made by Zolnour likely reflects a political reality in Iran, said Alireza Nader, a Washington, D.C.-based specialist on the country. Amidst popular uprisings against a regime that many citizens consider corrupt, a number of high-ranking Iranian officials have sent their children or relatives to live in the United States. This situation has fostered resentment among Iranians who question why a privileged class are free to travel and live in the U.S. while President Trump\u2019s travel ban has rendered doing so impossible for most ordinary citizens. Nader told us that \u201cI don\u2019t know if there was a specific policy to let [Iranian officials\u2019 families] settle [in the U.S.]. But there is definitely a sense of anger in Iran that the regime basically represses Iranians and says \u2018death to America,\u2019 yet sends its children to study in the U.S. and live good lives while Iranians are suffering.\u201d Zolnour\u2019s comment, Nader added, was likely a \u201cclumsy\u201d dig at Rouhani. As Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian noted, both Trump and Zoulnor probably intended it as a slight against their domestic adversaries and not a genuine revelation of truth about an international agreement they consider disagreeable: Fars is also regularly used as a vehicle to slander foreign nationals imprisoned in Iran who are denied due process or the right to defend themselves. Me included. For Trump that doesn\u2019t seem to matter. Any friend of fictions he\u2019s trying to sell to the American people is a friend of his. Still, it boggles the mind that he would uncritically accept information from such a quarter. But Trump \u2014 just like Zolnour and his fellow thugs in the Iranian regime \u2014 has little interest in factual accuracy. He\u2019s far more interested in assailing his domestic foes (in this case, his predecessor in office). And in this sense, we see a striking overlap between Trump and the mullahs. It\u2019s a sort of call-and-response relationship. A CBS News report on this issue similarly concluded by stating that:  Fox News noted in its story that there\u2019s no evidence to support Zolnour\u2019s claim. Zolnour is a hard-liner, and was using the claim as a cudgel against his more moderate foes in Tehran. His point was that allies of the comparatively moderate Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, were benefiting from a secret deal with the U.S. that runs counter to Iranian interests.  "

    "claim": "U.S. President Barack Obama ordered the CIA to train and/or arm Islamic State fighters.",
    "content": " In October 2019, after the reported death of the Islamic State group (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, some apparent supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump turned their focus towards his predecessor\u2019s record with regard to the terrorist network.  Right-wing conspiracy theorists have long claimed, implied, or speculated that former President Barack Obama has questionable loyalty to the United States, or that he is a secret Muslim and even a secret militant Islamist. Trump himself has repeatedly promulgated such false allegations, including the birther conspiracy theory, and during the 2016 presidential campaign he described Obama, more than once, as the \u201cfounder\u201d of IS.  After the death of al-Baghdadi \u2014 who reportedly detonated a suicide vest during a U.S. raid on a compound in Syria \u2014 multiple social media users shared one article in particular: a 2015 post on NewsPunch, a website formerly known as YourNewsWire, which is known to publish junk news as well as sensationalist distortions of real news stories. The headline read \u201cDeclassified Documents: Obama Ordered CIA to Train ISIS.\u201d The article reported that: \u201cGovernment watchdog Judicial Watch published more than 100 pages of formerly classified documents from the U.S. Department of Defense and the State Department. The documents obtained through a federal lawsuit revealed the agencies earlier views on ISIS, namely that they were a desirable presence in Eastern Syria in 2012 and that they should be \u2018supported\u2019 in order to isolate the Syrian regime. \u201cThe U.S. intelligence documents not only confirms [sic] suspicions that the United States and some of its coalition allies had actually facilitated the rise of the ISIS in Syria \u2014 as a counterweight to the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad \u2014 but also that ISIS members were initially trained by members and contractors of the Central Intelligence Agency at facilities in Jordan in 2012.\u201d         The NewsPunch article cited a few sources, including a 2015 article on the website Examiner.com, whose headline similarly claimed \u201cObama Ordered CIA to Train ISIS Jihadists: Declassified Documents,\u201d and a 2015 AlterVista blog post. The Examiner.com article stated: \u201cU.S. intelligence documents released to a government watchdog confirms [sic] the suspicions that the United States and some of its so-called coalition partners had actually facilitated the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) as an effective adversary against the government of the Syrian dictator President Bashar al-Assad. In addition, ISIS members were initially trained by members and contractors of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) at facilities in Jordan in 2012. The original goal was to weaken the Syrian government which had engaged in war crimes against their own people, according to a number of reports on Sunday.\u201d The Examiner.com report also cited as a source the same AlterVista post, which stated \u201cThe ISIS terrorists, who were initially trained by the CIA in Jordan in 2012 to destabilize the Syrian government, are engaged in crimes against humanity in the areas under their control.\u201d Notably, that post was in reality a republication of a May 2015 article published by Press TV, Iran\u2019s state-funded television network.  The claim that the CIA, under orders from Obama, had set out to train IS in 2012, was not actually contained or revealed in declassified U.S. Department of Defense documents, contrary to both NewsPunch\u2019s and Examiner.com\u2019s characterization. The claim instead originated in a report by an Iranian state-funded broadcaster.  Timber Sycamore Internal emails obtained by Judicial Watch through Freedom of Information Act requests included an August 2012 memo distributed to military, Defense, Homeland Security, FBI, and State Department officials, which gave a provisional outline of the circumstances surrounding, and participants involved in, the Syrian Civil War, as follows: \u201cThe Salafist, the Muslim Brotherhood, and AQI [Al Qaeda in Iraq] are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria. The West, Gulf countries, and Turkey support the opposition, while Russia, China and Iran support the [Assad] regime.\u201d Of particular relevance, that memo also included the following \u201cassumptions\u201d and predictions: 7. A. The [Assad] regime will survive and have control over Syrian territory. B. Development of the current events into proxy war: With support from Russia, China and Iran, the regime is controlling the areas of influence along coastal territories\u2026and is fiercely defending Homs, which is considered the primary transportation route in Syria. On the other hand opposition forces are trying to control the Eastern areas\u2026adjacent to the Western Iraqi provinces\u2026in addition to neighboring Turkish provinces. Western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey are supporting these efforts\u2026 [Emphasis added]        The memo thus indicated that Western countries, including the United States, were at that time supportive of the opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. This was not a revelatory point in October 2019, nor in May 2015, when Judicial Watch published the internal documents, nor even in 2012, when the Obama administration openly and publicly declared its support for the rebels. The memo does not even mention U.S.-backed training of Syrian opposition forces, and certainly does not articulate a viewpoint that is pro-IS, or reflect a desire or intent, on the part of Obama himself or any part of his administration, to train, equip, bolster or facilitate IS. In fact, the very same memo, quoted so extensively in the articles mentioned above, actually cites the emergence of IS in Iraq as one of the potentially \u201cdire consequences\u201d of the instability caused by the Syrian Civil War, stating: 8. D. The deterioration of the situation has dire consequences on the Iraqi situation and are as follows: 1. This creates the ideal atmosphere for AQI to return to its old pockets in Mosul and Ramadi, and will provide a renewed momentum under the presumption of unifying the jihad among Sunni Iraq and Syria, and the rest of the Sunnis in the Arab world against what it considers one enemy, the dissenters. ISI [Islamic State of Iraq, a precursor to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or IS] could also declare an Islamic State through its union with other terrorist organizations in Iraq and Syria, which will create grave danger in regards to unifying Iraq and the protection of its territory. However, the United States did train and arm Syrian rebels, beginning in late 2012/early 2013. The program began as a covert CIA operation, but was later formalized and given the code name \u201cTimber Sycamore,\u201d although it remained classified. Trump ordered the operation to be closed down in 2017, according to reports. During its years of operation, Timber Sycamore reportedly saw hundreds of millions of dollars spent, annually, on arming and training thousands of anti-government Syrian rebels. That\u2019s largely what happened, but according to multiple reports and investigations, some of the arms provided to the rebels were stolen or traded and ended up on the black market in Syria, with some ultimately being acquired by IS fighters.  That was an unfortunate and inadvertent consequence of the program, rather than its aim. Indeed, far from intending the program to be used to train or arm IS fighters, the Obama administration actually set up a separate initiative, with Congressional approval, specifically to train and equip Syrian rebels to fight against IS. The program was not a success and was shut down in 2015.  Conclusion Both NewsPunch and Examiner.com claimed that Obama had \u201cordered the CIA to train ISIS.\u201d That\u2019s not what happened. According to multiple reports by reputable news organizations, the CIA (under the Obama administration) carried out a covert program of training and arming Syrian rebels to fight against the Assad regime. That\u2019s largely what the program achieved, too; but as a result of greed and corruption, some of the weapons supplied to the rebels were sold on to the black market, and some of those ended up in the hands of IS fighters.  One could conduct a reasonable debate about the Obama administration\u2019s overall management of the program, its efforts to vet the intermediaries involved, or prevent foreseeable theft or smuggling of the weapons, and so on. But one cannot, based on the facts available, claim that Obama \u201cordered the CIA to train IS.\u201d He didn\u2019t. Moreover, we know for a fact that he implemented a program that set out to do just the opposite \u2014 training and equipping Syrian rebels to fight and destroy IS.  "

    "claim": "New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was previously named \"Warren Wilhelm Jr.\" and once supported the socialist government of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.",
    "content": " In May 2019, a widely shared Facebook post made several interesting claims about the personal background and history of New York mayor Bill de Blasio, who had just announced that he was in the running for the Democratic nomination for U.S. president in 2020. On 17 May, a Facebook user posted what appeared to be a photograph of de Blasio in his younger days, along with the following caption: \u201cMeet Warren Wilhelm Jr. He worked for the Quixote Center, which strongly supported the Marxist\u2013Leninist ruling government of Nicaragua, the Sandinista National Liberation Front. Warren, better known as Bill de Blasio, is the current mayor of New York \u2026 he also announced he\u2019s running for president.\u201d  Much of the post\u2019s content was accurate \u2014 de Blasio was indeed once a strong supporter of the revolutionary socialist Sandinista government in Nicaragua \u2014 but elements of it were somewhat misleading. The Mayor of New York is not \u201cbetter known\u201d as Bill de Blasio, a framing that might suggest a certain degree of subterfuge or secrecy on his part. Rather, de Blasio was born Warren Wilhelm but legally changed his name to Bill de Blasio for personal reasons having to do with his relationship with his parents.         This suggestion of dishonesty was made explicit in another May 2019 Facebook meme which incorporated the text the earlier post but added: \u201c*None* of them are who they say they are\u201d in apparent reference to other Democratic presidential candidates:  While de Blasio was once a strong supporter of the Sandinista regime, he has since resiled somewhat from that support and has criticized aspects of the leftist regime, important contextual information that was left out of the May 2019 memes. Background Warren Wihelm Jr. The 109th mayor of New York City was born Warren Wilhelm to his parents Warren Wilhem and Maria de Blasio in Manhattan on 8 May 1961. He grew up in Connecticut and later Cambridge, Mass. As a child, he took on the nickname \u201cBill,\u201d as reflected in a 1979 Boston Globe profile of his accomplishments as a 17-year-old student leader named as \u201cWarren (Bill) Wilhelm Jr.\u201d According to a 2013 New York Times article, which was informed by interviews with de Blasio and his family members, Warren Wilhelm Sr., a Harvard economist who received a Purple Heart in World War II, regularly drank to excess and developed a difficult relationship with his wife and children. In 1969, Maria de Blasio filed for divorce, and in July 1979, Wilhelm Sr., who had terminal lung cancer, shot himself to death in Connecticut. In an interview with the National Public Radio affiliate WNYC in September 2013, de Blasio said he had begun to identify more closely with his mother\u2019s side of the family in the months and years leading up to his graduation from high school and his father\u2019s eventual suicide. As part of that difficult process, he decided to add his mother\u2019s maiden name to his own name in 1979, going by \u201cWarren de Blasio-Wilhelm\u201d:        \u201cI had made the initial decision even in the senior year of high school that I was starting to think about the name. \u2026 I asked for one of the diplomas or one of the certificates to have de Blasio put in as a middle name. That was in May and he didn\u2019t die until July so already something was deep in me starting to feel like I really wanted to identify myself at least also with my mother\u2019s side.\u201d According to the New York Daily News, court documents show that the future mayor of New York legally changed his name to Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm in 1983. Our search of records from Kings County Civil Court in Brooklyn showed that he legally changed his name to Bill de Blasio in January 2001, although in practice he had already taken on that name for some years, as evidenced by a 1996 news article that named \u201cBill de Blasio\u201d as Bill Clinton\u2019s re-election campaign director in New York City. The May 2019 memes were correct in claiming that de Blasio had once been named Warren Wilhelm Jr., but despite the deeply personal reasons for his name changes, which relate to a traumatic family history, de Blasio has publicly discussed them, something that undermines any suggestions of subterfuge or secrecy on his part. The Quixote Center During the 1980s, de Blasio was a strong supporter of the revolutionary socialist government of Nicaragua, formed by the Sandinista National Liberation Front, commonly known as the Sandinistas. The then-mayoral candidate acknowledged his activities in a September 2013 interview with the New York Times, which outlined his political efforts, including a brief visit to Nicaragua in 1988: Mr. de Blasio, who studied Latin American politics at Columbia and was conversational in Spanish, grew to be an admirer of Nicaragua\u2019s ruling Sandinista party, thrusting himself into one of the most polarizing issues in American politics at the time. The Reagan administration denounced the Sandinistas as tyrannical and Communist, while their liberal backers argued that after years of dictatorship, they were building a free society with broad access to education, land and health care \u2026 Mr. de Blasio became an ardent supporter of the Nicaraguan revolutionaries. He helped raise funds for the Sandinistas in New York and subscribed to the party\u2019s newspaper, Barricada, or Barricade. When he was asked at a meeting in 1990 about his goals for society, he said he was an advocate of \u201cdemocratic socialism.\u201d \u2026 The roots of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s progressive brand of politics lie in the shadows of volcanoes, thousands of miles from the city he now hopes to lead, at a decaying health clinic in Masaya, a small Nicaraguan city. Mr. de Blasio, bearded, gawky and cerebral, had arrived in the city as part of a 10-day tour of Nicaragua in 1988, the capstone of the year he spent as an employee of the Quixote Center, a social justice group in Maryland. The center, founded by Catholic leaders, officially did not take sides in the Nicaraguan dispute, though much of its aid went to help families sympathetic to the Sandinistas. \u2026 In 1987, Mr. de Blasio was hired as a political organizer, soon after he finished graduate school at Columbia, earning $12,000 a year. He worked inside the Quixote Center\u2019s Maryland office, converted apartments filled with homegrown squash and peace posters. Hunched over his desk with a phone to his ear \u2014 his colleagues likened him to \u201cBig Bird with a beard\u201d \u2014 he oversaw efforts to solicit and ship millions of dollars in food, clothing and supplies to Nicaragua. He also proved to be a skilled provocateur, twice being arrested during rallies against United States foreign policy that were held in the Washington area. In 1990, after the Sandinistas were voted out of power in Nicaragua, de Blasio (using the name William Wilhelm) reflected on the party\u2019s time in government in an interview with the New York Times: \u201cThey gave a new definition to democracy. They built a democracy that was striving to be economic and political, that pervaded all levels in society.\u201d However, speaking to the Times for its 2013 article, de Blasio somewhat downplayed his support for Sandinistas and articulated a measure of criticism of the movement: \u201c\u2026 Mr. de Blasio said he was also not blind to the party\u2019s imperfections. He said the revolutionary leaders were \u2018not free enough by any stretch of the imagination,\u2019 pointing to their efforts to crack down on dissent by shuttering newspapers and radio stations.\u201d We asked a spokesperson for de Blasio\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign whether the mayor still largely stood by his support and advocacy for the Sandinistas, or whether he had regrets about his activities at that time. We did not receive a response in time for publication. "

    "claim": "Some immigrant children were placed with human traffickers during the Obama administration.",
    "content": " On 17 June 2018, right-wing blogs published a flurry of stories reporting that the administration of former United States President Barack Obama had handed immigrant children over to human traffickers. The reports were posted in response to the public outcry over a policy enacted by Obama\u2019s successor, Donald Trump, whose administration in April 2018 announced a \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy. Under this policy, all adults who are caught crossing the southern U.S. border between ports of entry are being charged with federal crimes and then separated from accompanying children.  As the policy went into effect, news reports documenting scenes of distraught, traumatized children being torn from their parents by immigration authorities, and images migrant children being held in cages, created a backlash from both sides of the political spectrum against the Trump administration. In response to the growing fallout, the president\u2019s supporters wrote up stories criticizing his predecessor based on a 2015 criminal case and 2016 Senate report stemming from a Marion, Ohio human trafficking ring that used migrant children for forced labor on an egg farm. Right-leaning blogs like WesternJournal.com\u2019s Conservative Tribune for example confusingly reported the media was \u201csilent\u201d about the case while aggregating their story from a New York Magazine report: The left-leaning media stayed strangely silent when the detention of migrant children went on for years before Trump took office\u2026 and now it looks like they also kept quiet when Barack Obama\u2019s administration literally placed immigrant children in the hands of human traffickers just a few years ago. \u201cThe United States government placed an unknown number of Central American migrant children into the custody of human traffickers after neglecting to run the most basic checks on these so-called \u2018caregivers,\u2019\u201d New York magazine  reported in 2016, based on a Senate report.         It\u2019s an obviously false statement that the \u201cleft-leaning media stayed strangely silent\u201d about the case, because a simple Google search reveals it has been thoroughly reported on by local and national outlets and is the subject of a PBS documentary film. As the text notes, Conservative Tribune\u2019s own story was based on such reporting.  In July 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted a ring of traffickers led by Aroldo Castillo-Serrano and accused them of smuggling children into the United States. They were also accused of lying to Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) by posing as relatives in order to gain custody of children in its care and use them for forced labor in Marion, a city north of Columbus. The federal indictment, filed in U.S. district court in Ohio accuses Castillo-Serrano and his conspirators of forcing the children to live in squalid trailers and work six or seven 12-hour days a week, using threats and physical violence as coercion. According to the Justice Department, Castillo-Serrano pleaded guilty in August 2015 to counts related to trafficking. He was sentenced to more than 15 years in prison and ordered to pay restitution to the victims. The case spurred a Senate subcommittee investigation led by Rob Portman (R-Ohio) which concluded the processes used by ORR to screen sponsors \u201care inadequate to protect the children in the agency\u2019s care.\u201d At the time, HHS lacked a system to screen potential sponsors for signs of trafficking, like accumulating multiple unrelated children. It did not physically assess homes children were being placed in and did not do adequate background checks on adults residing in those homes. The report found that in 2014, \u201cHHS permitted a sponsor to block a child-welfare case worker from visiting with one of the victims, even after the case worker discovered the child was not living at the address on file with HHS.\u201d As a result of the investigation, HHS and the Department of Homeland Security entered into an agreement to hammer out a joint plan that would address the issues raised in the report. As of 26 April 2018, that still had not happened according to Portman, who released a statement blasting the agencies for their failure to take action. He wrote: The agreement said the agencies would enter into a detailed \u201cJoint Concept of Operations\u201d that would spell out what the agencies would do to fix the problems. They gave themselves a deadline of February 2017. That was over a year ago. It\u2019s now April 2018. We still don\u2019t have that Joint Concept of Operations \u2014 the JCO \u2014 and despite repeated questions from Sen. Carper and me, as well as our staffs, over the past year, we don\u2019t have any answers about why that is. In fact, in a recent meeting, a DHS official asked our investigators why we even cared about the JCO. The issue of HHS\u2019s lack of accountability for unaccompanied immigrant children came to a head in May 2018 when HHS acting assistant secretary of Administration for Children and Families Steven Wagner told a Senate oversight committee that the agency could not account for 1,475 children it had placed with sponsors from October to December 2017. The furor over that story accompanied outrage over the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, with critics raising concerns that the federal government was unnecessarily overwhelming an already-overburdened system with traumatized children. To make matters worse, an investigation published 19 June 2018 by McClatchy revealed that the figure was only a snapshot from a three-month period and the number of children who are unaccounted for by HHS is actually nearly 6,000. The figure is likely exacerbated by an April 2018 agreement that allows background check information, including immigration status, of caregivers like parents and relatives to be shared with immigration authorities. McClatchy reported: The new estimate comes as backlash widens over President Donald Trump\u2019s\u2019 decision to separate parents and children. Advocates argue the growing numbers of unaccounted children should be expected as families and sponsors become more fearful of federal officials that is now using information from government social workers to run immigration checks and, in some cases, target sponsors, including parents and family members, for removal. We have reached out to HHS with a number of questions regarding the care of newly-separated children and the method with which they will be tracked and eventually reunited with parents. We have not received a response. "

    "claim": "Law enforcement agents have announced that \"antifa\" is planning extended violent unrest or civil war beginning on 4 November 2017.",
    "content": " In August 2017, rumors began to spread on social media that anti-fascists (a name often shortened to \u201cantifa\u201d, which has become shorthand for a subset of protestors, usually clad in black and accessorized with bandannas and who are evidently unnerving bloggers and vloggers enough to be the pet topic of many an angry online rant) were planning extended unrest, riots, killing random citizens, or outright civil war beginning on 4 November 2017:  Depending on the source, \u201cantifa\u201d (always treated as though it is one homogenous, unified group) is purportedly planning extended riots, joint violence alongside Black Lives Matter and the Black Panthers, or a coup of the American government. The rumors seem to have originated from a video originally published on 30 August 2017 by an individual named Jordan Peltz. Peltz was widely (and incorrectly) identified as a \u201cU.S. Marshal\u201d in the video, which shows him wearing what looked like an official badge that is actually simply printed on his shirt. However, he is not actually law enforcement or military \u2014 Peltz instead evidently works as some combination of bail bondsman and bounty hunter. (Claiming to be a United States marshal is very popular among the sovereign citizen set; those involved claim to answer only to their interpretation of common law and maintain they are not subject to other legal conventions, including getting driver\u2019s licenses and paying taxes. Local, state, and federal governments tend to disagree.)         On Instagram, Peltz describes his work as \u201c#fugitiverecovery\u201d and \u201c#warrantservice\u201d:  Peltz published a video to \u201cclear the air\u201d on 27 September 2017 after reporter JJ MacNab, whose beat includes anti-government and sovereign citizen groups, wrote a thread on Twitter about how militia groups are being goaded into taking up arms against anti-fascists:  Peltz responded by stating that his video, which gave an impression he was either predicting or calling for a November 2017 civil war, had been edited \u2014 although he didn\u2019t specify when, by whom, or why, despite millions of views and thousands of comments, he had remained unaware it had been altered until he saw reports:  Finding out my video meant for me and few friends had been taken and edited.

Please, view my IG to see what else was falsely claimed \u2014 Veritas\u2019AequitasUSA (@TacticalPoet84) September 28, 2017        On 29 September 2017, InfoWars published an article using Peltz\u2019s \u201ccivil war\u201d wording: Antifa is planning a new round of nationwide riots on November 4 as part of a plot to start a \u201ccivil war\u201d that will lead to the overthrow of the Trump administration. Far-left militants plan to \u201cgather in the streets and public squares of cities and towns across this country\u201d in the hope of building momentum for civil unrest that leads to nothing less than domestic regime change. \u201cOur protest must grow day after day and night after night\u2014thousands becoming hundreds of thousands, and then millions\u2014determined to act to put a stop to the grave danger that the Trump/Pence Regime poses to the world by demanding that this whole regime be removed from power,\u201d states a call to action on the RefuseFascism website. A longer screed posted on the Revolutionary Communist website makes it clear that Antifa is not prepared to wait for electoral change from Democrats, and will engage in a \u201cferocious struggle,\u201d based on plans outlined in a book written by Bob Avakian, the Chairman of the Revolutionary Communist Party, which is called The Coming Civil War. The page also cited \u201cantifa\u201d web sites, neither of which threatened violence. One provided a list of Facebook events, and the other read in its entirety: ON NOVEMBER 4, 2017: We will gather in the streets and public squares of cities and towns across this country, at first many thousands declaring that this whole regime is illegitimate and that we will not stop until our single demand is met: This Nightmare Must End: the Trump/Pence Regime Must Go! Our protest must grow day after day and night after night\u2014thousands becoming hundreds of thousands, and then millions\u2014determined to act to put a stop to the grave danger that the Trump/Pence Regime poses to the world by demanding that this whole regime be removed from power. Our actions will reflect the values of respect for all of humanity and the world we want\u2014in stark contrast to the hate and bigotry of the Trump/Pence fascist regime. Our determination to persist and not back down will compel the whole world to take note. Every force and faction in the power structure would be forced to respond to our demand. The cracks and divisions among the powers already evident today will sharpen and widen. As we draw more and more people forward to stand up, all of this could lead to a situation where this illegitimate regime is removed from power. Spread the word and organize now. Be a part of making history. Don\u2019t let it be said that you stood aside when there was still a chance to stop a regime that imperils humanity and the Earth itself. Join in taking to the streets and the public squares day after day and night after night demonstrating that In the Name of Humanity, We REFUSE to Accept a Fascist America. On November 4, 2017, we will stand together with conviction and courage, overcoming fear and uncertainty, to insist that: This Nightmare Must End: The Trump/Pence Regime Must GO! @AntifaChecker, a Twitter feed devoted to sniffing out phony \u201cantifa\u201d accounts, said it was not even aware of the call to action:  yeah, we haven\u2019t heard anything about november 4 \u2014 Antifa Checker (@AntifaChecker) October 1, 2017  An article in L.A. Weekly reported on both the freeway protest and upcoming events: Their placards bore letters that spelled out \u201cNOV 4 IT BEGINS.\u201d But they couldn\u2019t get enough volunteers to hold all 12 letters, so the tallest among them, the ones with the broadest wingspans, held up two letters each. The eight people weren\u2019t enough to block the on-ramp, so some motorists were able to swerve around. [Organizer and USC film professor Perry] Hoberman says the protest was conceived in part to get the word out about a Nov. 4 demonstration the group is planning. He says it\u2019s being modeled on the Women\u2019s March held in January at Pershing Square and that organizers hope the action will include an encampment in a public place, \u00e0 la Occupy Wall Street, or at least a prolonged series of protests over several days. At one point on Tuesday they knelt on the freeway, which organizer Michelle Xai says was to acknowledge \u201cblack and Latino people who have been and continue to be murdered by police.\u201d A video of the protest uploaded to the group\u2019s Facebook page has more than 700,000 views. Many of the 24,000-plus commenters ask for more information about Nov. 4. Plenty of others object to the group\u2019s inconveniencing motorists, and some appear to endorse running them over. It is true that some groups linked to the antifa movement planned co-ordinated protests on 4 November 2017, but that had nothing to do with Peltz\u2019s video expressing disdain for the group in August 2017, nor did he appear to have any insider law enforcement knowledge, as he does not work as law enforcement himself. When a wave of rumors about 4 November anti-fascist protests began, his clip became part of the claim as \u201cevidence\u201d that a \u201cfederal officer\u201d warned of coming violence. In reality, a list of apparently peaceful protests were paired with an older, unrelated video to create the impression of a looming threat. Peltz himself walked the claims far back after his video brought him unwanted attention and scrutiny. There was an uptick in the rumor\u2019s spread on 1 November 2017, when the groups advertised the 4 November 2017 demonstrations in the New York Times.  "

    "claim": "The Trump administration reversed a previous decision to put land in trust for the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe.",
    "content": " Just three years shy of the 400th anniversary of the legendarily peaceful meal shared by members of the Mashtree Wampanoag tribe with newly-arrived Pilgrims in an event that has since been commemorated as Thanksgiving, descendants of those same Native Americans protested in the U.S. capital against a variation on a sad historical theme. After being promised that 321 acres of their ancestral land would be preserved in trust, the tribe saw their hopes dashed when the Trump administration reversed course from its predecessor. The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe is currently suing the federal government because the Department of the Interior (DOI) on 7 September 2018 reversed an Obama-era decision to put 321 acres of land in trust on behalf of the tribe. Although the final outcome rests on a court\u2019s interpretation of whether the tribe was under \u201cfederal jurisdiction\u201d according to a 1934 law, the land is viewed by the indigenous community as their means to future self-determination. Thus, as many Americans planned for a Thanksgiving feast, tribe members and their supporters marched on the U.S. Capitol protesting the decision, which they say could cost them lands the tribe has lived on for 12,000 years. In an op-ed for the Boston Globe explaining the community\u2019s plight, tribal council vice chairwoman Jessie Little Doe Baird wrote: In fact, injustice at the hands of the federal government is happening today. On Nov. 14, the Mashpee Wampanoag led a march to the Capitol to call on Congress to prevent our reservation from being dissolved by the Trump administration. We have been fighting this battle since September 2018, when the Department of Interior decided to take land held in trust for Mashpee Wampanoag Nation out of trust \u2014 effectively dissolving our reservation. This Thanksgiving, we are calling upon all Americans to share this story to help our voices be heard and to stop this injustice. Congress needs to enact legislation that will restore our lands and reaffirm the spirit of the cooperation, now so famously celebrated and embodied in Thanksgiving.         According to court documents, the situation stemmed from a years-long battle in which the tribe \u201csought to address its landlessness\u201d and petitioned the DOI \u201cto acquire in trust approximately 170 acres of land in Mashpee, Massachusetts, and approximately 150 acres near Taunton, Massachusetts.\u201d The tribal community planned to use the land for \u201cself-determination and self-governance\u201d as well as housing, education, and cultural preservation. They also wanted to ensure the preservation of an ancestral burial ground and develop land in Taunton for an Indian gaming facility \u201cwith revenues intended to support the Mashpee tribal government and meet the needs of Tribal members,\u201d court documents stated. Mashpee Wampanoag members received happy news on 18 September 2015 when they were informed the federal government would acquire 151 acres in Taunton and 170 in Mashpee and hold the land in trust for the tribe. But some East Taunton residents filed suit over the issue in 2016, and a federal court sided with the residents against the tribe, holding that the Interior Department did not have the authority to take land in trust for the tribe in the manner they did. Both parties appealed that decision, but in 2017 the U.S. Justice Department dropped their participation in the appeal, leaving the Mashpee Wampanoag to contest the issue on their own.  Then on 7 September 2018, the DOI issued a decision that reversed their previous one, finding that the Mashpee Wampanoag were not eligible to have land held in federal trust for them because they didn\u2019t meet the criterion of having been considered \u201cunder federal jurisdiction\u201d in 1934, the year the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) was passed, a status paramount to a tribe\u2019s receiving land in trust.   The tribe then asked the court for a stay of their original appeal of the Taunton plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit while they pursued a separate lawsuit against the DOI to compel that agency to set aside their decision declaring the tribe ineligible to be granted land in trust. \u201cIn its Decision, the Department failed to apply established law, contorting some of the relevant facts and ignoring others to engineer a negative decision,\u201d the tribe\u2019s lawsuit states. \u201cAs a result the Department\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law, and if left unaddressed, will have a devastating impact on the Tribe.\u201d Interior Department officials ultimately determined that the tribe was not under federal jurisdiction in 1934, while the Mashpee Wampanoag contend they submitted \u201cmounds of evidence\u201d documenting that they were indeed under federal jurisdiction before 1934.  On 20 November 2018, the DOI asked the court for a 31-day extension on a deadline to respond to the tribe\u2019s lawsuit  Even if the Mashpee Wampanoag were to prevail in their lawsuit against the DOI, they would still have to succeed in their appeal of the Taunton lawsuit holding that the land was improperly acquired by the Interior Department in the first place.  On 9 October 2018, the plantiffs\u2019 attorney filed a request arguing that the tribe should not be granted another stay in the appeal process. In her op-ed, Baird noted that although her ancestors shared a peaceful meal with Pilgrims, the story often told about the original Thanksgiving leaves out a less heartwarming aspect of American history: This is a story of peace and cooperation between different peoples making an effort to uphold the promise of protection and support they offered each other through treaty. This is a story that can unite and inspire us in these divided times. But what is often left out of the Thanksgiving narrative is that Native peoples subsequently faced losses of land, broken treaties, and threats to our sovereignty as independent tribal nations \u2014 all at the hands of the US federal government. Standing Rock. The Standing Rock Sioux fought to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) from running half a mile from the tribe's reservation and land they consider to have been granted them under a treaty, fearing a leak in the pipeline would contaminate their only source of drinking water. The tribe and their supporters celebrated when the Obama administration on 4 December 2016 denied an easement that would have allowed pipeline construction on contested land, but the celebration was short-lived. That decision was reversed by President Donald Trump on 24 January 2017, who with an executive order pushed the pipeline construction towards completion. --> "

    "claim": "Immigration authorities are taking rosaries away from immigrants at the border.",
    "content": " In late May 2018, amid controversies over \u201czero tolerance\u201d positions on immigration taken by the administration of United States President Donald Trump, social media users began sharing an image of rosaries taken by immigration authorities at the border:  Rosaries confiscated from undocumented migrants by US border patrol agents. From a story in the @NewYorker https://t.co/lmVmPzM04f pic.twitter.com/n7iABgKFbY \u2014 Michael J. O\u2019Loughlin (@MikeOLoughlin) March 20, 2017  The image went viral amid swelling outrage over the ongoing treatment of migrants in the United States and those seeking refuge and asylum within its borders. In April 2018, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new policy in which the government would pursue criminal charges against any migrant caught making an unauthorized border crossing and take their accompanying children away from them. Since then, readers have been angered by stories of the federal government failing to account for hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children, and reports that hundreds of children \u2014 including dozens under age 4 \u2014 had been removed from their parents\u2019 care by immigration agents.         However, this was not a new image as of 2018. It was taken from a gallery published along with a 12 March 2017 story in The New Yorker and depicts the work of photographer Thomas Kiefer, who used to work as a janitor for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in Ajo, Arizona. The rosaries, he explained, were taken from immigrants along with other personal effects when they were arrested by border agents. Kiefer, who quit his CBP job in 2014, fished the unclaimed items out of trash cans as he cleaned. They would later become part of a photography collection he called \u201cEl Sue\u00f1o Americano\u201d: Spending time with the confiscated items \u2014 collecting them, curating them, looking at them, photographing them \u2014 changed Kiefer\u2019s relationship to his job. Before, he\u2019d been punching the clock so that he could get back to photography; now he felt awakened to hundreds of human dramas playing out around him during each shift. He\u2019d always known, technically, about the C.B.P.\u2019s strict confiscation policies, which were posted on bilingual signs and applied to all items classified as either \u201cnon-essential\u201d or \u201cpotentially lethal.\u201d But he hadn\u2019t spent much time thinking about these policies, and he hadn\u2019t realized how broadly they were applied, or just how many of the confiscated items \u2014 including cell phones and wallets, many still containing I.D.s, prepaid debit cards, and cash \u2014 were ending up in the trash, never to be returned. Increasingly, Kiefer felt uncomfortable at work: angry at the system that employed him, sad for the people being \u201cprocessed,\u201d and afraid that he would be caught making off with government property. But he kept sneaking out what he could, kept building his piles, and kept taking pictures, which at first he showed to no one. CBP spokesman Carlos Diaz told us that items taken away from immigrants upon arrest can be returned if the owner retrieves them \u2014 but according to immigrant advocacy organization No More Deaths, many never see their belongings again. According to a 2014 report authored by the organization: The failure to return peoples\u2019 belongings upon deportation represents one more way that ICE and CBP have failed to uphold basic law enforcement standards and human rights norms in their rush to expand the United States\u2019 detention and deportation apparatus. Items taken may include religious effects, but as No More Deaths points out, they include almost anything but the clothing being worn. Generally, personal property is held for 30 days after an arrest and then destroyed. In 2016, David Hill, a volunteer for No More Deaths who is tasked with helping reunite deported migrants with property taken by authorities described to the publication Vice a wide range of confiscated items: \u201cweddings rings, rosaries, and children\u2019s artwork\u201d along with identification cards, money, cell phones and medication: Due to the 30-day rule and the potential for belongings to be lost between agencies involved, immigrants are regularly deported with only the clothes on their back. No cellphones, no ID, no cash. We asked CBP for more detail on their policy on confiscation of personal belongings and how items are returned but did not receive a response. "

    "claim": "Former Barack Obama administration officials were \"caught advising Iran how to defeat U.S. foreign policy.\"",
    "content": " In early 2020, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of a report that claimed former officials from the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama had been \u201ccaught advising Iran how to defeat U.S. foreign policy.\u201d The claims originated in a June 1, 2019, segment broadcast by the right-wing One America News Network (OANN) and was delivered by Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump activist who has enthusiastically promoted a series of debunked conspiracy theories, including the Pizzagate and Seth Rich conspiracy theories. The segment can be viewed in full below. The following is an excerpted transcript of Posobiec\u2019s report, which carried the headline \u201cObama Officials Caught Advising Iran How to Defeat U.S. Foreign Policy\u201d: In a shocking new report today, we are now learning that former members of the Obama administration have been caught holding backchannel communications with Iranian officials on how to defeat U.S. foreign policy under the Trump administration. Specifically, they have been contacting Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif\u2026 In some cases, Obama officials reportedly attended Capitol Hill meetings to learn information about new U.S. policies, from Congressional Democrats, and then relayed that information to the Iranian government. This, of course, is in violation of the Logan Act, the same act that General [Mike] Flynn was spied upon [sic] after Trump had been elected.  Obama officials are desperate to rebuild the Iran nuclear deal that Trump dropped, and they are working with their allies in Congress to complete it. All of this comes at a time when the Trump administration has been successful in isolating Iran from many of its European allies and trading partners, and now in some cases is even seeming to isolate Iran from Syria and Russia by pulling Hezbollah fighters out of Syria, and Russia rejecting Iran\u2019s offer to purchase a major air defense system from Moscow. The U.S. has also labeled the Iranian Revolutionary National Guard a terrorist force, and sent military equipment to the Middle East, with escalating tensions against the Islamic republic.  To be clear, the fact that former Obama officials are holding shadow diplomacy with Iran and possibly passing them information from allies in Congress, to undermine U.S. foreign policy, is shocking, and must be investigated by [Attorney General William] Barr, immediately. Let that sink in.       The video was shared widely in the early days of January 2020 and re-promoted on Twitter by Posobiec himself, amid the escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iran at that time, especially after the Jan. 2 assassination by the U.S. of Qassem Soleimani, major general of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard.          We asked Posobiec to cite or provide sources and evidence in support of the claims in his report. In response, he sent us a link to a May 31, 2019, article published by the right-leaning website Breitbart, which bore the headline \u201cReport: Obama Administration Alumni Advising Iranian Regime on Dealing With Trump.\u201d That article was in turn based on an earlier report by The Daily Beast, with the headline \u201cTeam Obama Tells Iran: Don\u2019t Escalate, Don\u2019t Take Trump\u2019s Bait.\u201d That article reported that: As the Trump administration sent warplanes and an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf, a small group of former Obama administration officials reached out to their contacts in the Iranian government, including Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. Their message to Iran: Don\u2019t take Trump\u2019s bait. Stay calm. Conversations between former Obama officials and Iranian government officials have been ongoing since November 2016. Zarif, who visits the U.S. every year for the U.N. General Assembly in New York, usually meets with lawmakers, think tanks, journalists, and former officials when he is in town. But the recent round of conversations, which took place over the phone and in person over the last two months, came as lines of communication between the U.S. and Iran, through intermediaries in Europe and elsewhere, deteriorated. The Daily Beast\u2019s article cited unnamed purported former Obama administration officials as saying they had held informal discussions with current Iranian government officials, encouraging them not to respond in kind to the Trump administration\u2019s escalation of tensions between the two countries, as follows: \u201cOne former official who worked on the Obama administration\u2019s Iran policy told The Daily Beast he spoke with Iranian government officials as recently as a few weeks ago, as tensions were cresting. His message, he said, was simple: The Trump administration can escalate things plenty all by itself; the Iranians shouldn\u2019t take the bait, fuel the fire, and move things from bad to worse by, for example, pulling completely out of the nuclear deal.\u201d Neither The Daily Beast\u2019s nor Breitbart\u2019s articles contained the allegation (made by Posobiec) that those former Obama officials funneled to the Iranian government information they had acquired in congressional meetings. Furthermore, Posobiec\u2019s claim that the officials had been \u201ccaught\u201d engaging in discussions appears misleading, because The Daily Beast reported that some of those officials themselves told the website about the talks, which they purportedly viewed as \u201cnormal.\u201d  Since the version of events presented by The Daily Beast was purportedly based on briefings given by unnamed individuals, we cannot verify its key claims by contacting those individuals directly. As such, its claims, and the claims contained in Breitbart\u2019s subsequent article and Posobiec\u2019s later OANN report, remain unproven. If we obtain on-the-record evidence that definitively corroborates or disproves those claims, we will update this fact check accordingly.  "

    "claim": "As of October 2017, Ireland plans to reduce its rate of corporation tax to 8 percent.",
    "content": " As part of his push for tax cuts and tax reform, United States President Donald Trump held a press conference at the Rose Garden on 16 October 2017, during which he made an interesting comparison between the United States and other countries, in particular,  Ireland:  You look at other countries, what they\u2019ve done, and we\u2019re competing with other countries. When China\u2019s at 15 percent [corporate tax], when \u2014 I hear that Ireland is going to be reducing their corporate rates down to 8 percent from 12. But you have other countries also reducing \u2014 we can\u2019t be at 35 percent and think we\u2019re going to remain competitive in terms of companies and in terms of jobs. The relevant section begins at 1:34 below:            His claim regarding Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate is entirely false. Not only does the Irish government have no plans to reduce the country\u2019s rate of corporation tax to eight percent, but no such proposal has ever even been brought up. As it happens, Ireland reset all its taxation rates just days before Trump\u2019s comments as part of the country\u2019s annual budget, which took place on 10 October 2017.  The government kept the rate of corporation tax at 12.5 percent (not 12 percent, as Trump stated), and Paschal Donohoe, Ireland\u2019s Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform (roughly equivalent to Treasury Secretary) said at the time: We have a stable and competitive corporation tax system, which is internationally recognised as one of the most transparent in the world. Our position is clear. The 12.5 per cent tax rate is, and will remain, a core part of our offering. In a statement, a spokesperson for Donohoe directly refuted President Trump\u2019s claim: There are no proposals to change the corporation tax rate\u2026 Ireland\u2019s corporation tax regime and 12.5 percent corporation tax rate will continue to be competitive, while also offering long-term certainty to international business. As always, we will remain alert and responsive to any changes in the U.S. or global tax environment. On 18 October 2017, Ireland\u2019s Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar called Trump\u2019s claim \u201cfake news.\u201d In answer to a question from an opposition politician, Varadkar told the Irish parliament: In relation to our corporate tax, I can confirm that President Trump\u2019s claim that we\u2019re proposing to reduce our corporation profit tax to eight percent is indeed fake news. There is no such plan do so.  (You can watch a video of the Taoiseach\u2019s remarks here. The relevant section starts at 25.29.) It\u2019s not clear what the basis of Donald Trump\u2019s claim was, or where he had \u201cheard\u201d that Ireland would be lowering its corporation tax rate to eight percent. A reduction from 12.5 to 8 percent was not ever brought up by the Irish government in the runup to the October 2017 budget, nor was it proposed by any opposition political party. At the last general election in 2016, no political party proposed reducing the corporate tax rate in their manifesto.  One economic analysis has estimated that the effective rate of corporation tax in Ireland \u2014 tax paid on a company\u2019s net operating surplus \u2014 is 8.4 percent, and it is just about conceivable that this is what President Trump had in mind. However, his claim that Ireland is about to reduce the corporate tax rate down from \u201c12 percent\u201d is a reference to the country\u2019s headline corporate tax rate (which is actually 12.5 percent), so it\u2019s still not clear what the source or logic of Trump\u2019s claim was.  Ireland has one of the lowest headline rates of corporate tax in the European Union, but has been under pressure from some European Union leaders seeking to establish harmonized tax policies across the continent, which would likely entail an increase from Ireland\u2019s current rate of 12.5 percent.

    "claim": "Authorities in Mexico have seized a massive shipment of cocaine headed towards a U.S. government facility.",
    "content": " On 19 November 2017, the YourNewsWire web site published an article positing that authorities in Mexico had seized a massive shipment of cocaine headed towards a U.S. government facility: Authorities in Mexico have seized a massive shipment of cocaine that was headed towards a U.S. government facility in America. Mexican Soldiers have now detained three men who were inside of the vehicle, claiming that they were employees of the Social Security Institute which has yet to be confirmed by the agency. The truck originated in the Tamaulipas state capital of Ciudad Victoria bound for Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas; and it remains unseen if it belongs to a Cartel or how they acquired the vehicle if that were the case. There will be an ongoing investigation involving both United States Federal Agencies and Mexican authorities to determine whether anyone from inside either nation\u2019s disaster programs was involved in the trafficking or even the theft of the vehicle. The reference to a Mexican seizure of \u201cU.S. government cocaine\u201d had no basis in reality, which is not surprising given that YourNewsWire is a fake news site that peddles in clickbait fabrications and has been banned from Google\u2019s AdSense advertising program as a result: [W]hile churning out demonstrably false narratives day in and day out has reportedly cost [YourNewsWire] 60 percent of its revenue after Google AdSense dropped it, the ad network Revcontent still allows YourNewsWire to monetize clicks, giving its publishers financial incentives to continue pushing bullshit to gullible right-wing audiences. This story was produced from a distorted version of a recent Associated Press report about Mexican authorities seizing cocaine that was concealed in a vehicle bearing markings of the Social Security Institute: Mexican authorities have seized more than 800 pounds (371 kilograms) of cocaine being transported toward the U.S. border inside a truck bearing the markings of the country\u2019s Social Security Institute. The institute, which runs hospitals and other social services, denied that any of its employees or vehicles were involved in the incident. A Defense Department statement said soldiers discovered the packets of drugs hidden inside the vehicle\u2019s mobile medical scanner at a highway checkpoint. The white truck had logo that sought to imitate those of one of the social security institute\u2019s anti-poverty programs. The truck had departed the Tamaulipas state capital of Ciudad Victoria bound for Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas. Soldiers detained three people on board who said they were employees of the Social Security Institute. The institute later said in a statement that none of the three were its employees. The Social Security Institute referred to in this report is a Mexican agency that has nothing to do with the U.S. Social Security Administration. The Associated Press report contained no indication that the confiscated cocaine was intended for a U.S. destination (other than that it was being shipped to a Mexican city that was \u201ctoward the U.S. border\u201d) or had any connection to any facility or persons involved with the U.S. government. Moreover, the photograph that accompanied the YourNewsWire story was taken from a completely unrelated, ten-year-old news report about Mexican authorities seizing and burning 134 tons of marijuana. "
