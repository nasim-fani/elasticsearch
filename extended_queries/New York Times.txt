    "claim": "A man who stabbed his pregnant girlfriend \u201cwon\u2019t be charged\u201d because of New York\u2019s recently enacted Reproductive Health Act.",
    "content": " On 22 January 2019, New York state enacted the Reproductive Health Act (RHA), a law that \u2014 as described by its advocates \u2014 was intended to bring New York state, which had legalized abortion prior to the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, in line with the less restrictive federal standards generated by that ruling and modern medical guidelines: The Reproductive Health Act would fix a troubling gap in New York\u2019s abortion law. New York reformed its abortion law in 1970, three years before the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in Roe v. Wade. While New York\u2019s abortion statute allows abortion throughout a pregnancy when necessary to preserve a woman\u2019s life, the statute does not allow abortion care after 24 weeks from the commencement of pregnancy to preserve a woman\u2019s health or in cases of fetal non-viability. Thus, although the U.S. Constitution requires state law to allow for abortion in each of these circumstances, New York law does not comport with Supreme Court jurisprudence and the law is inconsistent with current medical guidelines. The most controversial effect of this act was that it removed abortion from the New York criminal code. Prior to the RHA, homicide charges could encompass the abortion of \u201can unborn child with which a female has been pregnant for more than twenty-four weeks\u201d even if the fetus were not viable. Now in New York abortion is regulated under public health law rather than under the criminal code. This issue drew significant national attention following the New York Post\u2019s coverage of the gruesome murder of Jennifer Irigoyen and her unborn child by her boyfriend, Anthony Hobson: Hobson was captured on surveillance video at around 1 a.m. as he dragged Irigoyen from the hallway of her third-floor apartment to a stairwell, officials said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a knife! He\u2019s going to kill the baby!\u201d Irigoyen had shouted, a witness previously told The Post. The expectant mother was then knifed multiple times in the torso, neck and abdomen, authorities said. She was rushed to Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, but neither she nor her unborn baby could be saved.         Hobson was charged with second degree murder on 8 February 2019. The Post later reported that prosecutors had \u201cinitially included a charge of abortion \u2026 but rescinded it because of Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s new Reproductive Health Act.\u201d Meris Campbell, a spokeswoman for the New York district attorney, told the New York Times that \u201cprosecutors dropped a second-degree abortion charge after learning that the Reproductive Health Act, which was signed on Jan. 22, had stripped the crime from the state penal code.\u201d This case became a galvanizing point for the pro-life movement. The Times cited the statements of New York State Catholic Conference spokesperson Dennis Poust, who tweeted that \u201cThanks to the #RHA, it\u2019s open season on pregnant women in New York.\u201d On 11 February 2019, Bill Donohue, the president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, penned a story for LifeNews.com with the headline \u201cHe Stabbed His Girlfriend\u2019s Stomach to Kill Her Baby, Won\u2019t Be Charged Because of New York\u2019s Abortion Law.\u201d Donohue\u2019s headline was misleading. Though it was made clear in the body of the article that Dobson was still being charged with second-degree murder, the headline made it sound as though he were not being charged with any crime. According to Daniel R. Alonso, a former chief assistant prosecutor in the Manhattan DA\u2019s office, who spoke to the Times, the dropping of the abortion charge would not have affected Dobson\u2019s potential sentence length: Alonso \u2026 said in an interview \u2026 that charging Mr. Hobson with abortion would not have affected his potential sentence for murder, which supersedes an assault charge. \u201cThe basic thing is, because the killing of the fetus is the same act as the killing of the mother, even though they were separate charges under the old law, you couldn\u2019t get more than 25 to life,\u201d he said. New York State Senators Liz Krueger and Anna Kaplan, the two co-sponsors of the Reproductive Health Act, argued in an 8 February 2019 editorial published in the Albany Times Union that the RHA does not prevent \u201cappropriate charging and sentencing of violent perpetrators\u201d: The RHA removes abortion from the penal code, treating it just like every other medical procedure. This has led to accusations that the RHA eliminates the ability for victims to seek justice when a violent crime causes the loss of a pregnancy. This is yet more misinformation. Physical assault resulting in the loss of pregnancy qualifies as first-degree assault, which carries a penalty of five to 25 years, far more than the previous sentence for \u201cunlawful abortion.\u201d Furthermore, judges have discretion to increase the penalty in cases where the crime was particularly violent. The RHA does not prevent appropriate charging and sentencing of violent perpetrators. The ambiguously constructed assertion presented by LifeNews and others that a man \u201cWon\u2019t Be Charged Because of New York\u2019s Abortion Law\u201d is only partially true. Dobson won\u2019t be charged with \u201cunlawful abortion\u201d because the RHA removed that crime from the state penal code, but he is still charged with murdering his girlfriend, and the dropping of \u201cunlawful abortion\u201d charges against him will not alter his prospective sentence length if he is convicted.

    "claim": "A man named Rudolph Fentz who had mysteriously disappeared 74 years earlier turned up alive in Times Square in 1950.",
    "content": " In 1950, a New York City police officer who was working missing-persons cases examined the body of an approximately 30-year-old man that was brought into the morgue. The man had shown up in the middle of Times Square at 11:15 p.m. that evening, \u201cgawking and looking around at the cars and up at the signs like he\u2019d never seen them before,\u201d then was quickly hit and killed by cab when he tried to cross a street against the traffic lights. The pockets of the deceased\u2019s clothing held multiple pieces of coinage and currency of forms that had not been produced for several decades, yet many of them were in mint condition. His possessions also included items from types of businesses that no longer existed in New York City (i.e., a bill from a livery stable and a brass slug from a saloon), a letter postmarked in 1876, and cards bearing the name Rudolph Fentz with an address on Fifth Avenue. Further investigations turned up no listings for a \u201cRudolph Fentz\u201d in New York City phone directories; the Fifth Avenue address listed on the dead man\u2019s cards had been a business rather than a residence for many years, and no one there had heard of Rudolph Fentz; the deceased\u2019s fingerprints matched none on file; and no current missing-persons reports or inquiries fit the details of the body in the morgue. Moreover, the dead man\u2019s clothes appeared to be about 75 years out of date in style, his apparel bore tags with the name and address of a tailor whom no one had ever heard of, and his hat bore a tag from a store that had gone out of business many years earlier. The investigating officer finally turned up a listing in an old phone directory for a \u201cRudolph Fentz, Jr.,\u201d a man in his sixties who had passed away five years earlier. His widow had since moved to Florida, but by mail she supplied the information that her husband\u2019s father, Rudolph Fentz, had disappeared sometime in the 1870s, having gone out for a walk around 10:00 p.m. one evening and never returned. A search of the missing-persons file for 1876 turned up a report for a \u201cRudolph Fentz,\u201d whose clothing and address corresponded to those of the man killed in Times Square in 1950.  This ostensible report from NYPD Capt. Hubert V. Rihm about the unexplained disappearance \u2014 and inexplicable reappearance 74 years later \u2014 of what appeared to be Rudolph Fentz has been reproduced in various forms since the 1970s as one of the many tales that seemingly confirms the existence of time travel. Yet it is not a true account at all, but rather an excerpt from a short story titled \u201cI\u2019m Scared,\u201d which was penned by science fiction writer Jack Finney (whose best known work was the novel \u201cThe Body Snatchers\u201d) and published in Collier\u2019s magazine in 1951. In that story, the narrator is puzzled when he catches a broadcast of a radio program that had gone off the air several years earlier. He then tracks a series of unusual events that are indicative of temporal disturbances: A man received a telephone call from his sister that she insisted she hadn\u2019t made until three days later; a bank discovered that a check had been deposited the day before it was written; a letter mailed from Wyoming was delivered to a New York City address just seventeen minutes later; and a man was shot and killed by a gun that police had found and impounded the previous day. The narrative involving Capt. Rihm and the reappearance of Fentz was the longest and most detailed vignette offered in \u201cI\u2019m Scared\u201d as evidence of the narrator\u2019s discovery of rifts in time occurring all around New York City. The cause of those temporal disturbances \u2014 and the message of \u201cI\u2019m Scared\u201d \u2014 was explicated in the story\u2019s closing paragraphs: Haven\u2019t you noticed, too, on the part of nearly everyone you know, a growing rebellion against the present? And an increasing longing for the past? I have. Never before in all my long life have I head so many people wish that they lived \u201cat the turn of the century,\u201d or \u201cwhen life was simple,\u201d or \u201cworth living,\u201d or \u201cwhen you could bring children into the world and count on the future,\u201dor simply \u201cin the good old days.\u201d People didn\u2019t talk that way when I was young! The present was a glorious time! But they talk that way now. For the first time in man\u2019s history, man is desperate to escape the present. Our newsstands are jammed with escape literature, the very name of which is significant. Entire magazines are devoted to fantastic stories of escape \u2014 to other times, past and future, to other worlds and planets \u2014 escape to anywhere but here and now. Even our larger magazines, book publishers and Hollywood are beginning to meet the rising demand for this kind of escape. Yes, there is a craving in this world like a thirst, a terrible mass pressure that you can almost feel, of millions of minds struggling against the barriers of time. I am utterly convinced that this terrible mass pressure of millions of minds is already, slightly but definitely, affecting time itself. In the moments when this happens \u2014 when the almost universal longing to escape is greatest \u2014 my incidents occur. Man is disturbing the clock of time, and I am afraid it will break. When it does, I leave to your imagination the last few hours of madness that will be left to us; all the countless moments that now make up our lives suddenly ripped apart and chaotically tangled in time. Well, I have lived most of my life; I can be robbed of only a few more years. But it seems too bad \u2014 this universal craving to escape what could be a rich, productive, happy world. We live on a planet well able to provide a decent life for every soul on it, which is all ninety-nine of a hundred human beings ask. Why in the world can\u2019t we have it? "

    "claim": "An astrophysicist warned that a \"newly discovered Planet X\" could wipe out all life on Earth as early as April 2016.",
    "content": " On 6 April 2016, the New York Post aggregated a news item originally published by the UK tabloid The Sun, which cited \u201ctop space scientist\u201d Daniel Whitmire as holding that a \u201cnewly discovered planet could destroy Earth any day now\u201d: A mysterious planet that wiped out life on Earth millions of years ago could do it again, according to a top space scientist. And some believe the apocalyptic event could happen as early as this month. Planet Nine \u2014 a new planet discovered at the edge of the solar system in January \u2014 has triggered comet showers that bomb the Earth\u2019s surface, killing all life, says Daniel Whitmire, of the University of Louisiana. The astrophysicist says the planet has a 20,000-year orbit around the sun and, at its closest to us, it knocks asteroids and comets toward Earth. Fossil evidence has suggested most life on Earth is mysteriously wiped out every 26 million to 27 million years. Whitmire claims Planet Nine\u2019s passage through a rock-laden area called the Kuiper Belt is responsible for the \u201cextinction events.\u201d The material as presented was hardly convincing from an astrophysics-centric perspective, as its most compelling portions utilized weasel words such as \u201csome believe\u201d and \u201csome are convinced\u201d without elaborating upon whether \u201csome\u201d were actual scientists or apocalypse cultists. We located some additional information on the topic via a 30 March 2016 press release from the University of Arkansas concerning \u201cPlanet X\u201d and other mass extinctions that have been observed in global fossil records: Periodic mass extinctions on Earth, as indicated in the global fossil record, could be linked to a suspected ninth planet, according to research published by a faculty member of the University of Arkansas Department of Mathematical Sciences. Daniel Whitmire, a retired professor of astrophysics now working as a math instructor, published findings in the January issue of Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society that the as yet undiscovered \u201cPlanet X\u201d triggers comet showers linked to mass extinctions on Earth at intervals of approximately 27 million years.         An initial red flag that appeared in contrasting the Post\u2018s outlandish claims and the university press release was the age of some of the discoveries in question. While the current viral article repeatedly references an imminent apocalyptic event due to a \u201cnewly discovered\u201d planet, the university press release describes study that has been ongoing for more than 30 years: Whitmire and his colleague, John Matese, first published research on the connection between Planet X and mass extinctions in the journal Nature in 1985 while working as astrophysicists at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Their work was featured in a 1985 Time magazine cover story titled, \u201cDid Comets Kill the Dinosaurs? A Bold New Theory About Mass Extinctions.\u201d More illuminating is the fact that the university press release makes absolutely no mention whatsoever of any imminent catastrophes. That item is notably inconclusive and ends with a question about the planet\u2019s potential impact on the fossil record over the course of millions of years: Whitemire and Matese\u2019s theory is that as Planet X orbits the sun, its tilted orbit slowly rotates and Planet X passes through the Kuiper belt of comets every 27 million years, knocking comets into the inner solar system. The dislodged comets not only smash into the Earth, they also disintegrate in the inner solar system as they get nearer to the sun, reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth. In 1985, a look at the paleontological record supported the idea of regular comet showers dating back 250 million years. Newer research shows evidence of such events dating as far back as 500 million years. Whitmire and Matese published their own estimate on the size and orbit of Planet X in their original study. They believed it would be between one and five times the mass of Earth, and about 100 times more distant from the sun, much smaller numbers than Caltech\u2019s estimates. Matese has since retired and no longer publishes. Whitmire retired from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2012 and began teaching at the University of Arkansas in 2013. Whitmire says what\u2019s really exciting is the possibility that a distant planet may have had a significant influence on the evolution of life on Earth.  \u201cI\u2019ve been part of this story for 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is ever a final answer I\u2019d love to write a book about it.\u201d We contacted Whitmire via e-mail to ask about the Post\u2018s claim that all life on Earth could be wiped out in April 2016, and he quickly replied: \u201c\u200bNo truth to the story at all. That\u2019s quite impossible.\u201d We also got in touch with the press department at the American Museum of Natural History\u2019s Hayden Planetarium to find out more, but we have not yet received a response. Nonetheless, aside from the alarmist claims of two tabloids, we found no evidence there was any truth to the immediacy of the \u201cPlanet X\u201d rumors. "

The image is real and was taken shortly before Easter in 1956. One newspaper, the Oxnard Press-Courier, published the photo on 31 March 1956 with the following caption:  Huge crosses, formed by lighted windows, blaze above New York\u2019s skyline as part of an Easter display in Manhattan\u2019s financial district. This scene, photographed from the roof of the Municipal Building, features 150-foot-high crosses in the City Services Co., City Bank   Farmers Trust Co., and the Forty Wall Street Corp. buildings. (United Press Telephoto)             As for the claim that this form of light display would cause an uproar today, it should be noted that Oklahoma City used building windows to depict crosses during the holidays as recently as 2010:  The Empire State Building also displays festive lights during religious holidays (red, green and white for Christmas, pastal fades for Easter, blue and white for Chanukah) and Chicago\u2019s Daley Plaza has featured a Nativity Scene since 1984.

    "claim": "In the 17th century, New Amsterdam built a protective wall along its northern perimeter (analogous to Trump's border wall) to keep \"bad hombres\" out, but it failed to achieve its stated purpose in that the British successfully invaded the city by sea.",
    "content": " In early January 2019, as the battle between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over funding for Trump\u2019s promised border wall dragged on, social media users weighed in with arguments for and against erecting a physical barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border. One of the more interesting claims to emerge from these debates was that a protective wall built by Dutch settlers on the northern border of 17th-century New Amsterdam (now New York City) failed to accomplish its stated purpose \u2014 that is, stopping outsiders from invading the city. In 1664, New Amsterdam was overtaken by the British, who eventually demolished the wall and replaced it with a street (aptly named Wall Street). The specifics of the claims varied from post to post. A 29 December entry shared on the subreddit r/nyc said the wall was built \u201cTo keep the Indians out.\u201d Another version claimed the wall was built to keep the British out:  Do you know why they call it Wall Street in NYC? Because the Dutch literally built a wall to keep the British out of Dutch colonies. You want to know how well walls work? It isn\u2019t called New Amsterdam anymore.https://t.co/VnztJ2jxHU \u2014 Ocular Nervosa (@ocularnervosa) January 5, 2019          And yet another said the wall was built in the 1640s and was meant to keep the \u201cbad hombres\u201d out (an apparent reference to Trump\u2019s characterization of undocumented immigrants):  In the 1640\u2019s the Dutch inhabitants of New Amsterdam built a 12\u2032 wall to keep the bad hombres out. In 1664 the British ignored the wall and took New Amsterdam by sea. It\u2019s now called New York. They took down the wall and built a street. It\u2019s called Wall Street. pic.twitter.com/Cbhp9N8BDW \u2014 Joe Delmonaco (@JoeDelmonaco) January 7, 2019  Although the broad outlines of the story were accurate, the devil (as always) was in the details. The wall was built neither in 1625 nor in the 1640s, but in 1653, the year New Amsterdam, a Dutch settlement comprising the southern tip of Manhattan Island, was formally chartered as a city. The Dutch Republic was at war with England at the time. The stated purpose of the wall was to prevent the English (not Native Americans) from invading by land. According to city records, news reached New Amsterdam\u2019s leadership in March 1653 that British troops were amassing in New England (\u201cfor either defense or attack, which is unknown to us\u201d). They resolved to \u201csurround the greater part of the City with a high stockade and a small breastwork\u201d to defend against a possible land invasion. Thus began the planning and construction of the wall, which would consist of palisades of 9-foot-tall (not 12-foot-tall) wooden planks extending east to west across the breadth of the island. It was completed in four months. One of the best short histories of the New Amsterdam wall is a five-part essay by Michael Lorenzini of the New York City Municipal Archives, based on original records from the period. One thing he points out is that the wall was only one component of a system of defenses that included ditches in front of the wall, cannon emplacements on the river banks, and Fort Amsterdam at the southernmost end of the island, from which the Dutch could fire upon approaching ships.        Although the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652-1654) ended without the wall\u2019s being put to the test, it did play a part in the city\u2019s defense when Native American tribes attacked New Amsterdam in 1655, leaving a section of it damaged by fire. \u201cThe wall was rebuilt and enforced,\u201d Lorenzini told us via email, \u201cand practically every year there was a huge public works project to improve it, including in 1664 when they received word that English ships were on the way.\u201d Despite the end of official hostilities 10 years earlier, the English had never given up their designs on New Amsterdam. When in March 1664 King Charles II deeded all the land from Maine to Delaware to his brother, the Duke of York, the city scrambled to reinforce their defenses. A few months later, four British warships sailed into the harbor with the clear intention of taking the city. Not wanting bloodshed, New Amsterdam surrendered. Not a shot was fired. Is it reasonable to conclude from that outcome (as some critics of Trump\u2019s border wall have argued) that \u201cwalls don\u2019t work\u201d? Arguably, the wall did work, in that the British never attempted to invade New Amsterdam by land. We put the question to Lorenzini, asking him first if he found the comparison between New Amsterdam\u2019s wall and Trump\u2019s border wall apt. \u201cIn some ways, maybe,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut I would say it\u2019s more akin to the walled cities of Europe than a border wall such as the Great Wall of China or Hadrian\u2019s Wall.\u201d One example of a walled city was New Amsterdam\u2019s European namesake, Amsterdam, which was surrounded by defensive walls from the Middle Ages through the late 19th century. But the central purpose of all those walls was repelling invaders, not keeping out immigrants. In fact, the Dutch would have regarded stopping the comings and goings of peaceful foreigners as antithetical to their interests. Lorenzini continued: New Amsterdam was a port city; the lifeblood was the free flow of ships into and out of the docks along the waterfront. They traded with everyone, including the English, and especially the native Americans. What they were afraid of was English troops from the Connecticut and Massachusetts colonies coming into the city from the north, and, post-1655, raids from native tribes. At various times they were in conflict with the English and the tribes, but they always wanted to resolve differences and continue trading. The English were able to take the city peacefully because they promised the merchants to respect the traditions of the Dutch and keep what we would now call the multi-cultural flavor. Not to put too fine a point on it, but it might have been a Dutch city, but it was a city filled with various religions and ethnic groups and they liked it that way, unlike the Puritan cities to the north, which strived for homogeneous societies. So, it was a military border, not a border to provide immigration control. As a military border, it served its purpose \u2014 no one ever attacked the city from the north \u2014 but much like the Maginot Line in France, it provided a false sense of security and was easily bypassed. The Dutch colony of New Netherlands was not just the lower tip of Manhattan. It extended from Albany to Brooklyn and Queens and down to Delaware and a couple-hundred-meter wall was not going to protect the whole colony. Certainly the wall was thought valuable to the city\u2019s defenses by the English, who continued to expand and maintain it (as would the Dutch when they temporarily reclaimed the city in 1673-4) over the next three decades. It wasn\u2019t until 1699, when New York City had essentially outgrown the wall (and the wall had outlived its purpose), that city officials finally petitioned for its demolition, calling for the stones recovered from the battlements that then stood at intervals along the palisades to be repurposed to build a new City Hall. To clear up one last misconception, it is not the case that the street now known as Wall Street only came into existence after the wall was torn down. Known to the Dutch as the Cingel, the street was ready in use when the British assumed control of New Amsterdam in 1664. As they did with the city itself, they simply claimed it as their own and renamed it. "

    "claim": "A 1922 New York Times article reported that Adolf Hitler \u201cwas merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers\u201d.",
    "content": " On 10 February 2015, the New York Times re-released the first article they ever published about Adolf Hitler, who was then the chairman of the Nazi party. The story, dated 21 November 1922 and republished in the Times\u2018 \u201cFirst Glimpses\u201d section, opened with this introduction: On Nov. 21, 1922, The New York Times gave its readers their first glimpse of Hitler, in a profile that got a lot of things right \u2014 its description of his ability to work a crowd into a fever pitch, ready then and there to stage a coup, presaged his unsuccessful beer hall putsch less than a year later. But the article also got one crucial point very wrong \u2014 despite what \u201cseveral reliable, well-informed sources\u201d told The Times in the third paragraph from the bottom, his anti-Semitism was every bit as genuine and violent as it sounded. This re-release was widely covered by other news outlets immediately after it was posted in 2015, with many of them suggesting or implying its description bore similarities to the political movement of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. An excerpt from that 1922 article reads as follows: But several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitler\u2019s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers and keep them aroused, enthusiastic, and in line for the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to be employed effectively for political purposes. A sophisticated politician credited Hitler with peculiar political cleverness for laying emphasis and over-emphasis on anti-Semitism, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t expect the masses to understand or appreciate your finer real aims. You must feed the masses with cruder morsels and ideas like anti-Semitism. It would be politically all wrong to tell them the truth about where you really are leading them.\u201d This story was published early in both Hitler\u2019s career and in the existence of the Nazi party itself, whose followers were then called \u2018Hakenkreuzler,\u2019 or \u2018swastika wavers.\u2019 In November 1922, when this article was first published, Hitler had been Nazi party chairman for just over a year, and it had been only three years since he had delivered his first public political speech. Hitler\u2019s failed attempt to overthrow the local government in Bavaria, known as the \u201cBeer Hall Putsch,\u201d was one year away. The Times reached out to Hitler for comment in 1922, which he declined, as described in the story: \u201cHerr Hitler regrets he is unable to meet you as he is leaving town on important business for several days,\u201d was the answer received by The New York Times correspondent. His important business was going to Regensburg with three special trainloads of Munich admirers for the purpose of holding a series of reactionary inflammatory meetings and incidentally to beat up protesting Socialists and Communists with blackjacks if any dare protest, which is becoming increasingly rarer.

    "claim": "The Origins of Basketball's 24-Second Shot Clock",
    "content": " To most fans of the major professional team sports in the U.S. (i.e., baseball, football, basketball), the competitions they follow have pretty much always been the same as they are now.  Over the years the strategies have changed, the equipment has gotten better, the athletes have become bigger, stronger, and faster, and the leagues have tinkered with the rules a bit now and then (generally to maintain fan interest by increasing scoring), but the basic conditions and rules under which the games are contested were established long ago (baseball in the 19th century, and football and basketball in the first half of the 20th century).   One of these sports has changed considerably within the lifetime of its older fan base, however.  The NBA (formed in 1949 from two earlier professional basketball leagues, the National Basketball Association and the Basketball Association of America) didn\u2019t always feature the high-scoring, \u201crun and gun\u201d type of games that have become so familiar to modern fans.  In the early 1950s, basketball contests were too frequently boring, slow-moving, low-scoring affairs in which one team grabbed an early lead and then spent the rest of the game simply holding on to the ball until the clock ran out.   The league predictably tinkered with the rules a bit (primarily by expanding the lane from six feet to twelve feet in width, thereby reducing congestion under the basket and forcing teams to rely more on distance shooting), but by 1954 the NBA\u2019s economic viability was in serious trouble as paying customers began walking out of some dreadfully dull games.  The New York Times reported that \u201cprofessional basketball\u2019s existence was in jeopardy\u201d as fans became disgusted with the \u201ccontinual stalling and intentional fouling,\u201d losing interest as teams sometimes required half an hour to play out the final four minutes of a contest.  As John Taylor wrote in The Rivalry, his survey of the \u201cgolden age of basketball\u201d:  [The] game was still frequently boring, degenerating all too often into what were known as \u201cfreeze-and-foul\u201d contests, with the team in the lead playing possession ball to run out the clock and the losing team fouling to try to recover, the game stopping each time it succeeded.  In one notorious example of \u201cstall ball,\u201d as it was also known, on November 22, 1950, between the Minneapolis Lakers and the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons, the final score was 19-18. The Pistons coach, Murray Mendenhall, had decided not to run the ball but simply to hold it and wait until the end of the game to score the winning point.  He succeeded, but fans were reading newspapers in the stands; some walked out and demanded their money back, others swore never to buy another ticket to a professional basketball game.1  The solution to this dilemma was another rule change, one which might seem simple and obvious to today\u2019s fans, but which was revolutionary for professional basketball at the time.  Danny Biasone, the owner of the NBA\u2019s Syracuse Nationals franchise, argued that the league needed to place a limit on how long a team could hold the ball, thereby preventing one side from stubbornly hanging onto the ball until they were fouled (or until the clock ran out) and forcing both teams to play the game at a faster pace.           The implementation of this change \u2014 what Taylor described as \u201cthe single most important innovation in basketball since James Naismith invented the  game\u201d \u2014 was the 24-second clock. From 1954 onwards, every time a team gained possession of the basketball during a game, they had to attempt a shot within 24 seconds or turn the ball over to the other team \u2014 no more hanging on to the ball for minutes on end to run out the clock or force the other side to commit fouls. The new rule was implemented a little crudely at first (typically by giving a recruit a stopwatch and having him stand on a sideline and yell \u201cTime!\u201d whenever  24 seconds elapsed during a possession), but by the end of the season all the teams in the NBA had set up 24-second shot clocks around their courts that made the timers visible to players, officials, and fans.  The innovation was an immediate and obvious success: In 1953 and 1954 combined, only three times did a team score as many as 100 points in a playoff game; in the 1955 playoffs alone, one or both teams scored 100 points or more in over half the contests (eleven out of twenty-one games), and over the course of those two years attendance at NBA games jumped by 50 percent.  Surprisingly, though (or perhaps not, since every alteration to something familiar usually prompts at least a few objections, even when the changes are clearly for the better), the new rule had some detractors, such as New York Post sports columnist Milton Gross, who complained that \u201cMovement is no longer necessary. Ballhandling now becomes a liability. The strategic freeze is outmoded \u2026 It\u2019s become a game for mathematicians, statisticians, clock-watchers, and coaches who are afraid to attack their problem at its sources.\u201d But NBA president Maurice Podoloff offered an opposite opinion of basketball\u2019s recent rule revision in 1955, claiming that the league \u201cadopted the twenty-four-second rule and it has worked so well that I firmly believe it has proved the salvation of professional basketball.  So far this year attendance receipts at our games have increased 57 per cent.\u201d   The question we want to consider here, though, is \u201cWhy 24 seconds?\u201d Given our penchant for favoring round numbers, why didn\u2019t the NBA adopt a 30-second clock, or at least a 25-second clock?  What\u2019s so special about  24 seconds? The answer is that Danny Biasone, the aforementioned owner who pushed for the adoption of the 24-second rule, based his proposal upon his observations, experience, and simple arithmetic. In Biasone\u2019s judgment, basketball was most exciting when it was neither a stalling contest nor a wild shootout, but a well-paced game in which teams took 60 shots apiece. Since professional basketball games were 48 minutes long, Biasone divided 2880 (the number of seconds in 48 minutes) by 120 (the total number of shots taken per game when each team attempted 60 shots) and arrived at an optimal figure of one shot every 24 seconds.  From such a simple formula came a change that completely reinvigorated professional basketball, a rule  it is now hard to imagine the game ever did without. "

    "claim": "Chinese people are selling each other bags of fresh air because of air pollution.",
    "content": " It may have started as a joke in the Mel Brooks satire \u201cSpaceballs,\u201d but in February 2016 various publications began reporting that bottles of fresh air were being sold to Chinese customers seeking relief from persistent air pollution in major cities such as Beijing. As countries such as China and India have developed industrially, they have also developed major smog problems.  In December 2016, the New York Times reported that Beijing officials sparked controversy when they listed smog as a natural disaster: Beijing is still reeling from a grimy November, and public anger over smog is running high. Some are concerned that classifying the murky air as a natural disaster will reduce pressure on officials to fix the problem, The Beijing News said. Levels of fine particulate air pollution, known as PM2.5, soared to a monthly average of 100 micrograms per cubic meter in November, according to Luo Yi, head of the Ministry of Environmental Protection\u2019s environmental monitoring bureau, a ministry statement said. PM2.5 particles are smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, and they can enter deep into the lungs and even into the bloodstream. Across the so-called Jingjinji region \u2014 which is home to 130 million people and includes Beijing, the surrounding province of Hebei and the port city of Tianjin \u2014 the average PM2.5 level in November was 102 micrograms per cubic meter, Mr. Luo said. According to the World Health Organization, which has stricter guidelines than most countries, yearly averages of PM2.5 levels should not exceed 10 micrograms per cubic meter. Moses Lam, a Canadian entrepreneur, saw an unlikely product opportunity in this phenomenon: pristine Canadian Rockies air. Lam said his canned air business is booming: We\u2019re selling fresh air in China, but we sell in a can, not in a bag. We started our company first selling two Ziploc bags full of air. After we sold them on eBay, we figured there might be a bit of a market there, and we wanted to improve our product. So we started compressing air in cans.         Now Lam\u2019s company, Vitality Air, sells thousands of cans of fresh air collected from Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. He has customers in China, India and South Korea, with a developing market in Vietnam.  On 3 January 2017, the Chinese government announced that 24 cities were on \u201cred alert\u201d for smog, with \u201cred\u201d being the most serious level for alerts in China\u2019s four-tiered public warning system. Lam said that during the winter months, pollution gets worse because Chinese citizens are heating their homes and burning coal, which adds to pollution produced by coal-burning factories: The pollution and our sales for product goes hand in hand for sure. We see a spike in sales, we also see a spike in people asking for distributorship of our products. Every time this year we move thousands and thousands of bottles. Lam said he\u2019s seen photographs of Chinese people selling each other inflated bags of air, but that\u2019s not where he got the idea. Vitality, which incorporated in 2015, has a 24-foot trailer and 14,000 pounds of equipment (including a giant vacuum device) which Lam uses when he drives from Edmonton to Banff and collects 200,000 liters of air over about a 40-hour period. The air is compressed into containers that double as face masks, allowing customers to experience the smell and quality of Rocky Mountain air for about 160 breaths:  Lovin\u2019 that Rocky Mtn air! Puffing away all morning. On a natural high. @vitalityair #payingforair pic.twitter.com/5cIQdx1YaZ \u2014 Dave Mitchell (@mitchee69) June 10, 2016  Lam\u2019s idea has caught on. Leo De Watts and his company, AethAer, sell empty-looking jars for \u00a380 (nearly $100 U.S.) \u2026 but the emptiness is in the eye of the beholder. According to the company\u2019s web site, the jars contain air from pristine parts of Great Britain, including Dorset, Yorkshire and Somerset: A businessman is raking in thousands of pounds selling jars of \u2018fresh air\u2019 to people in China for \u00a380 each. Leo De Watts, 27, sells air collected in the British countryside and ships it over to polluted cities Shanghai and Beijing, where the wealthy elite pay a hefty sum for a few seconds of inhalation.        A video shows De Watts standing in a gusty English meadow with a woman appearing to \u201ccatch\u201d air in a large bag behind him:  The British newspaper The Independent notes that such products may be bought by consumers more as novelty or collector\u2019s items than as practical sources of clean air: As well as those buying the product to inhale, it is reportedly also being purchased by people who will never open it, but instead keep the jar for its novelty value. The air is collected using jars held in makeshift nets, which are held into the air and walked around in areas far removed from anywhere polluted \u2014 a process Watts describes as \u2018air farming\u2019. Reuters reported that a millionaire  Chinese philanthropist handed out cans of fresh air as a stunt to make a political point abut the environment: Chen Guangbiao, who made his fortune in the recycling business and is a high-profile philanthropist, on Wednesday handed out soda pop-sized cans of air, purportedly from far-flung, pristine regions of China such as Xinjiang in the northwest to Taiwan, the southeast coast. \u201cI want to tell mayors, county chiefs and heads of big companies: don\u2019t just chase GDP growth, don\u2019t chase the biggest profits at the expense of our children and grandchildren and at the cost of sacrificing our ecological environment\u201d, Chen said. Vitality Air\u2019s head said the pollution problem in China is so pervasive he doesn\u2019t believe will be corrected any time soon, and he acknowledged how serious it is \u2014 after a trip to China, he reported, he coughed for three weeks upon returning home to Edmonton.

    "claim": "Scientists have discovered a fuel thousands of times more powerful than gasoline and just one company is positioned to own a vast majority of its market share.",
    "content": " In April 2017, a viral marketing campaign created by Kent Moors (an allegedly well-resum\u00e9d individual who frequently offers expensive stock tips in ebook form and is sometimes used as an expert on television news segments) suggested that there is a new fuel called OBL that is 1,693 times more powerful than gasoline. The main thesis of his 44-minute video and accompanying article is that it would be wise to purchase cheap stock in an unnamed company that has exclusive access to OBL; however, the only way to find out the name of the company is to purchase a $99 ebook that the video advertises. This post does not seek to address the financial claims made in the ad. Instead, it aims to document the numerous and brazenly misleading scientific claims made about this new \u201csuperfuel\u201d.  What Moors refers to as OBL is lithium brine (found in salt lakes that have high concentrations of lithium) or their geologic deposits in the form of salts like lithium carbonate or lithium chloride. These raw materials are used to make lithium-ion batteries, common in cell phones and increasingly in demand for electric cars. A post at Stock Gumshoe makes a detailed case for concluding OBL is actually this resource, and the stated locations of the deposits (the Andes and Nevada) as well as Moors\u2019 discussion of electric automobile industry further support that conclusion. The reason the ad uses the term OBL (allegedly an acronym for the Spanish translation of \u201cwhite gold,\u201d \u201coro blanco\u201d), instead of the scientifically accurate term lithium carbonate, is likely due to the fact that saying \u201clithium demand will rise in the future as electric cars become more popular\u201d is far from a hot take, as evidenced by a fairly similar take published in Forbes nearly a decade ago:  Since a vehicle battery requires a hundred times as much lithium carbonate as its laptop equivalent, the green-car revolution could make lithium one of the planet\u2019s most strategic commodities. The rush is on to find and develop new sources of it, a race that has mining companies scouring the globe\u2019s remotest corners, from the high-altitude deserts of Chile and Bolivia to the wilds of northern Tibet.          The nearly hour-long, un-fast-forwardable video does not say what OBL is or identify the company with access to it (though it is likely a company called Lithium X), most likely in order to shield Moors\u2019 myriad vague claims from any critical rebuke. These claims are featured prominently in early portions of the video:  Unearthed in the Andes Mountains, these mysterious crystals contain what MIT researchers call energy\u2019s \u201cHoly Grail.\u201d [\u2026] A discovery made 13,000 feet up in the Andes Mountains is going to forever alter the global energy industry. Take a look at this picture. The locals call the mysterious crystals you see here \u201cOro Blanco.\u201d Translated, that\u2019s \u201cWhite Gold.\u201d However, Goldman Sachs has a different name for it. \u201cThe new gasoline.\u201d But that may very well be the understatement of the century. You see, Oro Blanco is 1,693-times more powerful than the gasoline that runs your car. Which is why Goldman Sachs is predicting it will eventually \u201creplace gasoline as the primary source of transportation fuel.\u201d   Before delving into the meat of the claim \u2014 the comparison to gasoline \u2014 it is worth noting that the image Moors asks us to look at is a stock photo of salt from a salt lake, not a groundbreaking image of \u201cblanco oro\u201d. The remarkably specific estimate of \u201c1,693 times more power\u201d than gasoline comes from the specious argument that \u201cone gallon of OBL\u201d can drive your car for 42,325 miles, while a regular gallon of gasoline may last about 25 (42,325 / 25 = 1,693):  Let\u2019s say you own a typical mid-sized American car. So you can probably drive about 25 miles on a gallon of gasoline. Maybe 40-50 if it\u2019s a hybrid-electric model like a Toyota Prius. Care to guess what would happen if you retrofitted your car to run on OBL? 50 miles to the gallon? Maybe 100 MPG? Or 500 MPG? Not even close. I\u2019d like for you to imagine: Pulling into your local gas station on empty, putting only a single gallon of this superfuel in your tank, and driving 42,325 miles before having to stop at that same gas station again. That\u2019s like driving from New York City to Los Angeles and back SEVEN times on a single gallon.  This is a deeply fallacious argument even if there was some basis to the figure 42,325 miles on a \u201cgallon\u201d of \u201cOBL\u201d (though we cannot find one). The explanation Moors gives for OBL\u2019s superior performance sounds nice and neat, but it stems from a comparison that makes apples and oranges look like identical twins:  So you\u2019re probably asking yourself, \u201chow is this even possible?\u201d I\u2019ll give you two reasons. One of them is simple science. And the other sounds like magic. First off, this crystal fuel can withstand extreme temperatures. Consider gasoline. It might start boiling at 104 degrees Fahrenheit. When it does, some amounts will evaporate. That\u2019s potential fuel that is vanishing into thin air. OBL doesn\u2019t have this problem. It doesn\u2019t boil until it hits 2,457 degrees Fahrenheit. [\u2026] Now, the second reason. [\u2026] It\u2019s [sic] \u201cenergy density\u201d is unrivaled.  Gasoline powers a car through the energy created by combustion (which is, incidentally, why you wouldn\u2019t want it to withstand extremely high temperatures), whereas a lithium-ion battery creates its power from the chemical energy generated by the movement of lithium ions.        This renders the first argument irrelevant, even if you ignore the fact that you can\u2019t \u201cfill\u201d a car with the raw precursor component of a lithium-ion battery, and the fact that that a battery requires A) other chemicals and B) the regular input of energy to reset that chemical system (i.e. the part where you charge it every 100-300 miles). The second argument \u2014 that lithium batteries are more energy dense than gasoline \u2014 can more accurately be described as a bald-faced lie. The implication that a lithium-ion battery\u2019s energy density, a quantifiable thermodynamic quality inherent to any substance, is greater than that of gasoline is not only false, it is the defining scientific hurdle to making electric cars a viable economic solution, as discussed in a post by the American Physical Society:  Stored energy in fuel is considerable: gasoline is the champion at 47.5 MJ/kg and 34.6 MJ/liter; the gasoline in a fully fueled car has the same energy content as a thousand sticks of dynamite. A lithium-ion battery pack has about 0.3 MJ/kg and about 0.4 MJ/liter (Chevy VOLT). Gasoline thus has about 100 times the energy density of a lithium-ion battery.  These factual problems are masked by Moors\u2019 frequent sidetracks into technically valid scientific statements that are both utterly irrelevant and diversionary, including this gem:  Astrophysicists have observed OBL being produced by dwarf stars and cosmic rays colliding. The explosion is so intense, it causes the stars to burn up to 100,000 times brighter than they did before. It also sets off a Galactic process known as stellar nucleosynthesis, which gives birth to this superfuel.  Stellar nucleosynthesis, the process that powers stars through nuclear reactions, is responsible for the formation of pretty much all elements heavier than helium in our universe, making this statement broadly true for nearly everything in the universe \u2014 a concept made famous by Carl Sagan\u2019s memorable quote, \u201cWe are made of star stuff,\u201d in the original run of Cosmos.  The statement makes you feel like you could power your car with the force of a stellar explosion, but it is, in reality, a meaningless letdown. This technique is a common one for Moors. In what can only be described as a brilliant use of semantics, he once tried to sell solar energy stock tips by branding solar power as Einstein\u2019s little known theory of \u201cspace energy.\u201d The invention of OBL fits neatly within Moors\u2019 technique of offering opaque hints about stocks while generally abusing science and the English language. The final suggestion made by the video is that this one undisclosed company has exclusive access to American lithium deposits, and therefore has a significant stake in the world market. Excluding the fact that multiple companies have ownership of different regions of the general deposit to which Moors refers (and that five companies dominate this market globally), the Nevada deposits are speculative and not necessarily viable, as discussed in a feature about the future of the American lithium market in Fortune:  Pure Energy Minerals [one company with an interest in the Nevada deposits] is trying to determine, and prove with its samples and testing, that the lithium brine in Clayton Valley is as high quality and in abundance as the small four-person team thinks it is. The company estimates that there are 816,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent underneath their land claims that stretch over 9,000 acres, or 14 square miles, of the basin. Lithium carbonate is a lithium compound and it\u2019s a standard way that lithium supplies are measured. In comparison, the global reserves of lithium carbonate equivalent\u2014which is the amount that can be economically mined right now\u2014is estimated to be about 75 million metric tons, according to the United States Geological Survey. The U.S. can only claim about 203,000 metric tons of those reserves right now.  To be clear, we are not arguing that lithium will not become a major player in the energy market, nor are we arguing that companies investing in American deposits are necessarily a bad bet, but merely highlighting another aspect of an impressively dishonest presentation. Ultimately, we rate this claim as false because it uses demonstrably misleading or false claims about the science behind the production and use of lithium batteries, invents terminology to hide the actual resource being discussed, and oversells the scarcity of access to deposits as well as the novelty of the resource, all with the motivation of selling an e-book for profit.

Vehicles bearing the Muslim Community Patrol Service\u2019s name (MCPS) and emblem were first spotted in parts of Brooklyn in December 2018, prompting media personality Laura Loomer to post a photograph of one of the vehicles above the caption \u201cThe job of the people driving the cars is to enforce Sharia law. In case you never thought Sharia would be in America, well, it\u2019s here. I HAVE BEEN WARNING ALL OF YOU!!!

Rabah said the group had around 30 regular members, with 30 others volunteering services on a more limited basis. The photographs seen online, he maintained, captured the group\u2019s patrol vehicle on what he called a \u201cdry run\u201d before the MCPS program\u2019s formal launch in 2019. \u201cMost of our patrolling is going to be motor patrol,\u201d Rabah said. \u201cWe will be driving. The goal is that with our presence, there will be a preventative measure for people who are inclined toward crime \u2014 that seeing the car would stop the average criminal. That\u2019s one thing. Two, if we were to see something we would say something; if we see suspicious activity, if we see someone\u2019s driving drunk [or] causing a disturbance, just by being in these areas we can contact 911 a lot quicker than someone who is in trouble before things get out of proportion.\u201d Besides acting as \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for police, he added, MCPS members are already connected to their communities enough to defuse situations while avoiding potential cultural misunderstandings. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to arrest people,\u201d he said. \u201cRather, if we see for example a young man smoking weed \u2014 we know him, we can come up to him, greet him and say, \u2018You might not care if a cop came to you right now and stopped you but you probably would care if your mom or dad found out that you were smoking weed.'\u201d While more than 30 members had already received certification in New York City\u2019s Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) program and each member must pass a background check, Rabah said, the MCPS had already won the support of officials in the New York Police Department\u2019s 72nd District and planned to work with them to receive further training. However a department spokesperson, Sgt. Jessica McRorie, seemingly offered a negative reaction toward MCPS\u2019 vehicles in an interview with the website PJ Media, saying \u201cThis is not an NYPD vehicle. The NYPD did not outfit or label this vehicle. This group is not officially sanctioned by the NYPD and they are subject to the law.\u201d By comparison, the website reported, the department endorsed another civilian patrol group, the Brooklyn Asian Safety Patrol (BASP), going so far as to allow it to use an official logo.  PJ Media offered nothing that demonstrated the MCPS could, or planned to, \u201cenforce Sharia law,\u201d beyond engaging in the speculative hypothetical that the MCPS might somehow \u201capply \u2026 Sharia in its community monitoring\u201d:  Given this background, the NYPD\u2019s full-throated insistence that there is no link between the Big Apple\u2019s police and the MCP suggests that the Islamic group does not enjoy the same status and training as [the Jewish patrol group] Shomrim or BASP. If the Muslim Community Patrol is off-book and does not coordinate with the NYPD, it may apply specific readings of Sharia (Islamic law) in its community monitoring. Since some forms of Sharia advocate honor killings, child brides, and other abuses, they may directly violate some American or New York City laws. Rabah asserted that his group\u2019s vehicles were approved by the 72nd Precinct before the test run.  \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for someone to \u2018outfit\u2019 our car,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for equal respect.\u201d Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said McRorie\u2019s remark \u201cdeserves further clarification by the NYPD.\u201d We asked the NYPD whether they shared the site\u2019s concern regarding \u201cSharia Law\u201d and whether any officials had met with members of the Muslim patrol, but the department did not respond prior to publication. Both MCPS and BASP, along with Shomrim, were honored by Brooklyn Borough President Erik Adams and Kings County District Attorney Eric Sanchez at a ceremony on 2 January 2019. During the ceremony, Adams called for additional funding to be offered to community patrol groups. "
