    "claim": "NASA issued a warning that Earth could be hit by an asteroid around Christmas 2019. ",
    "content": " On Oct. 23, 2019, the U.K. tabloid Express published an article that left some readers believing they need not make Christmas plans this year because Earth was in danger of being hit by a large asteroid:  The article was entitled \u201cAsteroid terror: NASA spot mammoth space rock to hit Earth\u2019s orbit five days before X-mas.\u201d The subheading gave earthlings an even smaller chance of survival: \u201cAN ASTEROID the size of the World Trade Centre is on a dangerous Earth-bound orbit that could see the rock smash the planet during Christmas festivities.\u201d When the article was regurgitated by even less-reputable websites, the fear-mongering title morphed into a factually inaccurate claim. For instance, the website Digital Wise rehashed this article under the title \u201cNASA Issues Warning Over Asteroid Predicted To Hit Earth Five Days Before Christmas!\u201d NASA has made no such announcement, and Earth is not in danger of being hit by an asteroid around Christmas.          These articles are all based on a real asteroid (known as 216258 2006 WH1) and its holiday approach toward Earth. However, these articles present the information as if this asteroid is particularly dangerous. But there\u2019s nothing unusually threatening about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1. NASA\u2019s Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) currently lists 26 near-Earth objects that are scheduled to pass by our planet within the next 60 days. While asteroid 216258 2006 WH1 (which was discovered in 2006) will truly be passing by earth around Christmas, CNEOS reports that the asteroid is expected to safely pass by earth at a distance of about 15.19 LD (lunar distance), approximately 3.6 million miles. Dr. Paul W. Chodas, the Director of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, told us in an email that there is \u201cnothing unusual or dangerous\u201d about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1: No, there is nothing unusual or dangerous about this asteroid. It is simply making a close approach to the Earth. Astronomers have been observing this asteroid\u2019s position for 13 years, we know its orbit very accurately, we can predict its close approaches accurately for the next 200 years, and we know with certainty that it cannot hit our planet. Lindley Johnson, NASA\u2019s Planetary Defense Officer and Program Executive of the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO), also told us that this asteroid \u201cposes no hazard to impacting earth\u201d:  NASA and other US agencies are lead players in the international effort to develop plans to respond to a possible Near-Earth Object (NEO) impact. In 2018, the White House released the National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan, which identifies key steps that US agencies need to take to better prepare the United States\u2014and the world\u2014for detecting and responding to a possible impact. NASA has been directed by Congress to catalogue and characterize all NEOs bigger than 140 meters, the ones that could be catastrophic. NASA is approximately 35% complete for NEOs 140 meters and larger, and approximately 96% complete for those 1 km and larger. Strategic investments in our space-based programs will lead to the benefit of all of humanity as we continue to catalogue any NEOs that pose a potential threat. This particular asteroid\u2019s trajectory has been well tracked by NASA\u2019s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies since it\u2019s discovery 13 years and poses no hazard to impacting Earth. Here\u2019s a little more information about near-earth objects from CNEOS. The organization writes on its website (emphasis ours):  On a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth\u2019s surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earth\u2019s surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago. With an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earth\u2019s surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth\u2019s atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth\u2019s surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories \u2026 \u2026 No one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.        NASA Near-Earth Object Observations Program is constantly monitoring the skies for approaching asteroids and meteors. So far, the program has discovered more than 19,000 NEOs. When NASA discovers an NEO, it works to determine as much information as possible about the object, such as its size, speed, and orbit, so that the agency can calculate when it will approach Earth and how close it will come when it does.  But the 19,000 NEOs in NASA\u2019s database aren\u2019t really what we have to worry about. The organization writes that thousands of NEOs have yet to be discovered: Asteroid impacts are a continuously occurring natural process. Every day, 80 to 100 tons of material falls upon Earth from space in the form of dust and small meteorites (fragments of asteroids that disintegrate in Earth\u2019s atmosphere). Over the past 20 years, U.S. government sensors have detected nearly 600 very small asteroids a few meters in size that have entered Earth\u2019s atmosphere and created spectacular bolides (fireballs). Experts estimate that an impact of an object the size of the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 \u2013 approximately 55 feet (17 meters) in size \u2013 takes place once or twice a century. Impacts of larger objects are expected to be far less frequent (on the scale of centuries to millennia). However, given the current incompleteness of the NEO catalogue, an unpredicted impact \u2013 such as the Chelyabinsk event \u2013 could occur at any time. Still, the chances of an asteroid larger than 140 meters hitting earth in the next 100 years is minimal: The current congressionally directed objective of the NEO Observations Program is to find, track, and characterize at least 90 percent of the predicted number of NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size\u2013larger than a small football stadium\u2013and to characterize a subset representative of the entire population. Objects of this size and larger pose a risk to Earth of greatest concern due to the level of devastation an impact would cause, and should continue to be the focus of global search efforts. While no known asteroid larger than 140 meters in size has a significant chance to hit Earth for the next 100 years, less than half of the estimated 25,000 NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size have been found to date. Asteroid 216258 2006 WH1 will pass by Earth a few days before Christmas. However, NASA has issued no warnings about a catastrophic impact, and CNEOS reports that this asteroid will get no closer than 3 million miles from Earth during its approach.  "

    "claim": "Dr. Anthony Fauci said there was \"nothing to worry about\" in late February 2020 in regards to COVID-19 and it was \"safe\" to do things like go to the movies and the gym.",
    "content": " As governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Read our coronavirus fact checks. Submit any questionable rumors and \u201cadvice\u201d you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.   In early April 2020, the Trump administration was facing strong criticism for its response to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. Against that backdrop, social media users shared posts critical of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the leaders of the administration\u2019s ongoing COVID-19 response. The posts accused Fauci of throwing U.S. President Donald Trump under the bus for a belated response to the growing public health crisis, while failing himself to adequately warn the American public of the looming disease threat. Social media posts by Trump\u2019s supporters highlighted an April 12, 2020, interview on CNN in which host Jake Tapper asked Fauci, \u201cDo you think lives could have been saved if social distancing, physical distancing, stay-at-home measures had started third week of February, instead of mid-March?\u201d To that question, Fauci gave the answer that earned him the ire of Trump\u2019s supporters: You know, Jake, again, it\u2019s the what would have, what could have. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to go back and say that. I mean, obviously, you could logically say, that if you had a process that was ongoing, and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives. Obviously, no one is going to deny that. But what goes into those kinds of decisions is \u2014 is complicated. But you\u2019re right. I mean, obviously, if we had, right from the very beginning, shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different. But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.         In rebuttal to this perceived criticism of the Trump administration, social media users accused Fauci of himself minimizing the threat in a Feb. 29 television interview. One such tweet, bearing the hashtag #FireFauci was retweeted by Trump on April 12, 2020, raising speculation that the president was preparing to fire the doctor.  Another tweet complained that Fauci had said it was \u201csafe\u201d to do things like go to the movies and the gym in early February and March but \u201cdropped Trump in the grease on CNN,\u201d or let the president take the blame. These criticisms ignore the context of Fauci\u2019s Feb. 29 commentary and the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 situation. On Feb. 29, Fauci gave an interview on the NBC morning talk show \u201cToday,\u201d during which he stated that at that moment in time, \u201cthe risk is still low, but this could change.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve said that many times even on this program,\u201d Fauci stated in that interview. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don\u2019t need to change anything you\u2019re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.\u201d The situation with COVID-19 in the United States was indeed drastically different on Feb. 29 than it was in mid-April.        On Feb. 29, news reports indicated there were 70 known cases in the U.S., and officials were reporting the first known death from the novel coronavirus on American soil. That day also saw the first few reports of \u201ccommunity spread,\u201d or transmission of the disease from an unknown source. Fauci did say on Feb. 29 that Americans did not need to change their routines for the time being, but he also noted that depending on how the COVID-19 outbreak played out, that could all change, and in the coming weeks, it did. Since that day, COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic, more than half a million cases have been reported in the United States, and the death toll has rapidly climbed past 20,000 with most of the American public under guidance to stay home in order to slow the spread of the virus. Fauci later clarified that in the April 12 interview, he was responding to a \u201chypothetical\u201d question about the administration\u2019s response but noted that his wording choice was \u201cpoor\u201d and that administration officials had in fact heeded his early recommendations about social distancing guidelines. Fauci also noted that his comments in a CNN interview were interpreted by some to mean that the Trump administration gave medical experts \u201cpush back\u201d that cost lives at the beginning of the outbreak. He acknowledged that his answer was not worded well and largely misconstrued. We therefore rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d "

    "claim": "Young women are inserting vodka-soaked tampons as a furtive way of getting drunk.",
    "content": " Although whispers about young women trying to furtively get their alcohol buzzes on by inserting vodka-soaked tampons into themselves have existed for more than fifteen years (our oldest printed reference dates to 1999, but the rumor is likely a fair bit older than that), cases documenting instances of women actually engaging in such a practice are rare to non-existent and well short of proving it to be the widespread phenomenon rumor makes it out to be.  Nonetheless, as with so many other stories about supposedly worrisome teen crazes, news outlets periodically run stories proclaiming insertion of \u201cvodka tampons\u201d to be a real and common activity, stories based on little or nothing more than mere repetition of rumor (e.g., \u201cWe\u2019ve heard teens are doing this\u201d). Arguing strongly against such rumors is the nature of tampons themselves. While these cylindrical compacted wads of cotton and/or rayon do soak up liquid readily (which is their purpose, after all), they also become nigh on impossible to insert into any bodily orifice when they are in such a saturated state.  Also, as blog editor Danielle Crittenden discovered when she experimented with the procedure, putting vodka into direct contact with vaginal membranes hurts like the dickens, with the pain not retreating after a few moments of discomfort but rather continuing unabated for as long as the liquor is present (and indeed well after). Crittenden\u2019s research also showed even a \u201csuper-plus\u201d tampon could absorb only 1.5 ounces of vodka, with a half ounce of that having to be wrung from it prior to insertion. The amount of alcohol therefore available to provide a buzz to thrill-seeking teens would be akin to that found in one typical mixed drink, a tipple hardly worth going to the trouble of inserting a vodka-soaked tampon into one\u2019s nether regions even if the procedure were pain-free and could be showed to work. As to why anyone would want to ingest alcohol in this fashion, three reasons are given for the purported practice: To do away with the problem of the smell of booze on one\u2019s breath, to bypass the stomach and thus more quickly benefit from the full effect of the hooch, and to eliminate the sort of gastric distress that leaves a heavy imbiber clutching the porcelain god at 4 a.m.         The most commonly-given reason, the avoidance of bowery breath, has the least going for it. If one were to ingest vodka vaginally (or anally, as the rumor is also expressed that way), the practice wouldn\u2019t result in booze-free breath because alcohol is partially expelled from the body via the lungs. Once liquor is in the blood, at least some of it gets breathed out, which is how breathalyzers measure blood alcohol content.  Also, the rumor\u2019s lynchpin, that as long as a teen gal has sweet breath her parents won\u2019t know their little darling has been tippling, isn\u2019t all that practical. It\u2019s not easy to conceal being three sheets to the wind; drunken behavior often gives the game away long before the stink of booze does.  Any teen who thinks avoiding parental detection is nothing but a matter of masking or eliminating the scent is probably in for a rude surprise. Even if putting liquor into direct contact with the mucus membranes of the vagina or rectum worked to speed alcohol into the bloodstream, the practice might come at a cost. Such membranes are sensitive, and the potential burning discomfort of flooding those areas with John Barleycorn\u2019s finest could prove memorable and not nearly adequately compensate for having advanced one\u2019s inebriation by a matter of minutes. Some claim taking in vodka through the insertion of liquor-soaked tampons might (and we\u2019re not going to test this theory, so we\u2019ll leave it at \u201cmight\u201d) work to keep one\u2019s dinner in place during a fierce night of partying, citing the notion it avoids the presence of large amounts of alcohol into the stomach, a presence that works to irritate the lining of that organ and thus prompt regurgitation of its contents.  (However, vomiting is one of the body\u2019s defense mechanisms against poisoning, so suppressing or avoiding that function is not generally a good idea.  In 2005, for example, a woman was charged with negligent homicide for administering a sherry enema that caused the death of her husband from alcohol poisoning.)  Another putative reason given for imbibing in this manner is bypassing the stomach avoids the calories associated with alcohol consumption. The rumor has become particularly attached to the Scottish rock band Mogwai. According to lore, while trapped in a European tour environment where hooch was hard to come by, the band members soaked tampons in vodka and inserted them into their rectal cavities in order to facilitate the swift and efficient entry of the small available stock of alcohol into their bloodstreams. The group maintains they never did this, and the belief they did arose from an innocent conversation with a journalist in which mere discussion of the practice was subsequently misremembered by that reporter as the group\u2019s having claimed to have participated in the activity themselves. Sightings:   Vodka-soaked tampons were referenced in an episode of the television crime drama CSI (\u201cTwo and a Half Deaths,\u201d original air date 8 May 2008). Also, in the TV series The Girlfriends\u2019 Guide to Divorce (\u201cRule No. 67: Don\u2019t Kill the Princess,\u201d original air date 13 January 2015), Lilly\u2019s14th birthday party is enlivened by the sudden cascade of her friends into the pool after vodka-soaked tampons have caused severe sensations of burning and stinging in the nether regions of the young partygoers.

    "claim": "The Trump administration is paying Southwest Key $458 million to run immigrant child detention centers, and its CEO earns a $1.5 million salary.",
    "content": " In late June 2018, a series of investigative news reports exposed the fact that Juan Sanchez, the chief executive of non-profit Southwest Key, was making a salary of $1.5 million while his organization had scored $458 million in federal grants to shelter detained children who had been taken from their parents at the southern U.S. border. The reports came amid widespread outrage over U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy and as viral stories often do, resulted in a number of memes that spread throughout social media:  Introducing pic.twitter.com/aYaDYIY38z \u2014 Samuel L. Jackson (@SamuelLJackson) June 21, 2018  Although memes are not always factual, the one shared by actor Samuel Jackson is. The figures were taken from a 19 June 2018 Bloomberg report: The nonprofit, Southwest Key Programs Inc., is to be paid more than $458 million in fiscal 2018, according to the data \u2014 the most among the organizations, government agencies and companies that run a detention and care system for immigrant children on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services. Southwest Key has about a dozen facilities in Texas, including a site at a former WalMart Inc. store in Brownsville that has drawn attention from members of Congress and national news organizations. [\u2026] Southwest Key rapidly increased the compensation of its CEO, Juan Sanchez, from about $269,000 in 2010 to more than $786,000 in 2015, the most recent year for which its tax returns are available through the website Guidestar.org. His compensation nearly doubled to $1.5 million in 2016, according to tax records for an Austin charter school he founded.         We independently confirmed with tax records publicly available through the non-profit tracking site Guidestar.org and public financial data posted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees programs for unaccompanied immigrant children, that the figures reported by Bloomberg are accurate. Sanchez\u2019s salary and money awarded to his non-profit both ballooned in recent years. In fiscal year 2017, Southwest Key was awarded more than $285,000,000 and about $211,000,000 in 2016. Sanchez\u2019s salary roughly doubled from 2015 to 2016. The Austin-based charity runs 27 immigrant children\u2019s shelters in Texas, Arizona and California, according to an archived version of its web site (which is currently down). It has been awarded almost half of the $948 million budgeted for the care of unaccompanied immigrant children by HHS. Southwest Key became the focus of heightened scrutiny in June 2018 amid outcry over Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy enacted in April 2018. Under the policy, all adults who cross the border between ports of entry were charged with federal offenses and their accompanying children were taken from them. Many of those children were placed at Southwest Key facilities, including Casa Padre, a converted WalMart in Brownsville, Texas reportedly holding 1,500. As people began asking questions about the welfare and whereabouts of the children, unpleasant answers began emerging. Among those providing those answers has been Antar Davidson, a 32-year-old whistleblower who worked at Estrella del Norte, a Southwest Key shelter in Tucson, Arizona from February 21 to 12 June 2018. Davidson described scenes of chaos after \u201czero tolerance\u201d went into effect. The facility was unprepared for the stream of younger children that began around May. The children, he said, were traumatized, disoriented, and acting out, running around, throwing things and fighting. \u201cIt was really a big mess,\u201d he told us in a phone interview. Davidson, who is of Brazilian descent, said he would hold classes for the martial art form capoeira. But during classes, \u201csome little six or seven year old would run in and an employee would be chasing them down.\u201d Many times, he said, the children had to be physically restrained by staffers. Training for situations requiring restraint increased in frequency when the younger children started showing up.  Davidson, who quit his job out of disillusionment, confirmed a story first reported by the Los Angeles Times. At one point he was asked to translate for a group of Brazilian siblings, aged six, ten and 16, who had been separated from their parents. The distraught, crying children, who were clinging to each other, were separated and placed in different parts of the facility because they were of different ages and genders. He was told to prevent them from hugging, because the shelter has a strict \u201cno touching\u201d policy. The result of the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy has been that more than 2,000 children have been taken from their parents at the border. The Trump administration has provided no information on how they will be reunified. Wrenching news stories and audio published by ProPublica of weeping children calling for their parents after being separated drew public outrage. In response, Trump signed an executive order on 20 June 2018 that does not reunite families already separated but seeks to change laws limiting the amount of time children can spend in detention, which could result in families being in detention indefinitely. We attempted to contact Southwest Key for comment and received no response. "

    "claim": "A photograph of children in orange jumpsuits depicts detained immigrant children.",
    "content": " In early June 2018, we received numerous e-mails from readers about a Facebook post showing immigrant children in orange jumpsuits: When and where was the picture of child prisoners in orange jumpsuits taken? Is it really of immigrant children separated from their families?  Sending you a photo, going around Facebook with immigrant children, supposedly removed from parents at US borders, posing at a detention facility, wearing orange prison jumpsuits. MOST posts are challenging as \u201cFake News\u201d, a lawyer friend says this is probably staged since PHOTOGRAPHS are not permitted in Homeland Security facilities nor the private prison contractors FOUR that we know of in TX. Church groups, lawyers, family can go, but cellphones &amp; cameras are forbidden, so we\u2019re wondering how did THIS PHOTO get so posed with the kids? Perhaps you\u2019ve already seen this photo? NO source on any of the photos. YES, it\u2019s tragic that children are being separated from parents &amp; being held in detention, like prison facilities, but I don\u2019t think we need to stage a photo. My church group friends, I know for a fact, distributed 670 backpacks Christmas week 2017, to CHILDREN LOCKED UP at Karnes County Detention Center, (Texas) Yes. 670 children, alone.  There is a photo going around on Facebook of children dressed in orange prison jumpsuits. There is no attribution to the photo. It is being used as proof of children who have been taken from their parents crossing the border. I would Ike to know where this photo is from and when it was taken. I have a feeling it is not what it claims to be. Several included a link to a Facebook post shared by Occupy Democrats on 8 June 2018: This shouldn\u2019t be happening in America, PERIOD. Follow Occupy Democrats for more! I don\u2019t care how you try to spin it. Children are not criminals. They don\u2019t belong in cages, PERIOD!          Neither the caption nor the image text used any immigration-specific wording, but no source for the photographs was provided. A reverse image search shows that the image appeared online as early as 2014 (and possibly earlier):  The photograph was originally used to illustrate a claim that in the United States, prisons are constructed more frequently than schools:  In 2014, the photograph accompanied an article about schools and prisons. It appears to be a still from the following video from Californians for Safety and Justice:  A description provides further insight: Russell Simmons served as Executive Producer for Californians for Safety and Justice\u2019s \u201cImagine\u201d video as part of its #SchoolsNotPrisons campaign, which calls for replacing prison and justice system waste with common sense solutions that create safe neighborhoods and save public dollars. The image likely caught on because of a real photograph that was leaked from a Texas courtroom which shows the mass trials that result from the Trump administration\u2019s so-called \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy, along with a story that appeared in The Intercept: A very small, very young woman with chiseled features and disheveled hair spoke. She had been apprehended two days earlier after rafting across the Rio Grande near a county park with big trees and picnic tables that abuts the international line. She wept as she told Morgan, \u201cI\u2019d like to apologize, but the circumstances in my country made me do it.\u201d She said she\u2019d been almost raped and killed there, and she had come to the U.S. for protection and to see if she could help her sisters escape the danger. \u201cYou are going to be sent to one of the immigration camps,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cYou can try and request asylum.\u201d By May 10, Morgan was starting to get rattled by the increasingly disturbing content of the allocutions. By then, the government had begun systematically separating mothers and fathers from their children, including children who are preschoolers. A week later, the government announced plans to house the children on military bases. "

    "claim": "A pair of memes accurately describes the benefits and downside of the social system in Denmark.",
    "content": " On 20 October 2015, the web site The Federalist Papers shared a meme in a post titled \u201cBRUTAL Meme Reveals Truth About European Socialist Countries\u201d which included a photograph of a woman and various criticisms about Denmark\u2019s general way of life:  That meme was something of a rebuttal to an earlier, similar graphic that had lauded Denmark\u2019s social infrastructure:  (The woman pictured in both these memes is Danish actress Mille Dinesen, her photograph taken from promotional material for the TV show Rita.)         The text of the \u201crebuttal\u201d meme began by stating: I am a school teacher in Denmark making about $61,000/year. We get free education. You don\u2019t have to pay for the doctor or the hospital, and students even get paid to learn. It all sounds so great \u2026 right? However, I forgot to mention that nothing is ever free \u2026 The minimum income tax in Denmark is 40%. A reliable estimate of the average salary for teachers in Denmark is somewhat tricky to calculate due to variables such as tenure and location. However, a 2014 estimate provided an income figure of just under $42,000 per year for Danish teachers (not $61,000). And it\u2019s slightly simplistic to say all healthcare is free in Denmark, as the cost of medical care varies depending upon residency status and coverage level. The rebuttal also states that the minimum income tax is 40% in Denmark (where tax revenue indeed comprised 48.6% of the country\u2019s GDP in 2013). Taxpayers in Denmark are subject to a progressive tax structure under which total taxes are between 41 to 56 percent of income [PDF]: Most personal income is subject to AM tax of 8%. This tax is deducted from the income before the other taxes are calculated. The income tax rates are progressive and comprise state, municipality and church taxes. The lowest tax rate is approx. 36% up to a marginal income tax rate of 51.95% exclusive of church tax. Including AM tax, the rates are 41% and 56%. Another portion of the meme indicated that Denmark\u2019s citizens were \u201cdeeply dependent\u201d on welfare to survive, but the country\u2019s unemployment rate of 6.3% was not much higher than the United States\u2019 5.3% in the same period. The meme continued: Also, [we] pay a sales tax of 25%, and on top of that the Government applies duties and fees. A gallon of gasoline is about $10. Tax on a car is 180%, meaning that a car that sells for about $25,000 in the United States (Honda Accord) to an astounding $45,000 in Denmark.        Value-added tax (VAT) in Denmark is indeed 25%, though additional \u201cduties and fees\u201d weren\u2019t specifically described by the meme. Gasoline is typically sold by the liter (not gallon) in Europe overall, and recent estimates provided a cost of $1.69 per liter in Denmark (or just under $6.40 a gallon, not $10). It\u2019s true that new cars in Denmark are taxed at 180%, in large part because Denmark (like some other countries) imposes higher costs of operation for private automobiles to encourage residents to use public transport and more energy efficient and lower polluting forms of transportation.   Denmark is the highest-taxed Nation in the World \u2014 taxed an average 80% on every dollar earned. Danes have the highest personal debt in the World. Few will ever own a car or a house. Anyone who makes over $80,000 annually pays a personal tax of 68%. This means that people with higher earnings have either found ways to evade the tax or have left the Country, taking their companies with them. Definitively selecting a single country to claim the title of \u201chighest-taxed\u201d is a slippery endeavor, as the structure of taxation varies significantly from one country to the next. Reports on taxes across the globe (including a popular annual data set released by firm PwC) almost never declare any one country the most-taxed (in a vacuum). Myriad confounding factors (such as relative cost of living, and whether social programs cover basic needs like healthcare) render a binary comparison of that description virtually meaningless. However, a list titled \u201cThese are the 19 countries with the highest tax rates in the world\u201d (based on the World Economic Forum\u2019s latest Global Competitiveness Report), published on 8 October 2015 didn\u2019t include Denmark among countries listed. By the metric of income tax rates, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data for 2015 placed Denmark third-highest (behind Belgium and Germany).  Similar, earlier data ranked Denmark behind France, Italy, and Croatia. As such, Denmark doesn\u2019t even have the highest tax rate in Europe (much less the world). We were unable to corroborate the claim that \u201c80% on every dollar earned\u201d in Denmark goes toward taxes, and determining which nations could be accurately described as having the highest amount of personal debt in the world again hinges largely on variable factors such as GDP, average income, and number of citizens. (Without specifics, those numbers could easily be distorted by fluctuations in population, for instance.) OECD data for 2014 indicated Denmark had the highest percentage of household debt based on percentage of disposable income:  That same table placed Denmark mid-to-high for comparative household net worth:         In 2013 Denmark\u2019s home ownership rate was roughly 63% (versus a comparable 65% in the U.S.), making the statement that \u201cmost residents would never own a home\u201d not very accurate. Similarly, recent OECD data indicated that there are 70 cars for every 100 Danes (indicating car ownership may be expensive, but it isn\u2019t rare). A 2007 New York Times article reported that some young Danes opt to move abroad (creating a skills drain), but that piece focused on individuals and not companies with business roots in the country. The meme concludes:   Denmark\u2019s suicide rate for the past five decades has averaged 20.8 per 100,000 people, with a highest rate of 32. The American suicide rate has averaged 11.1 during the last five decades and has never exceeded 12.7. More than 11% of adult Danes \u2014 supposedly the happiest people in the World \u2014 are on antidepressants. Everyone wants the American dream. In Denmark\u2019s neo-communism economy, no one will ever own or accomplish anything. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2019s most recent statistics, Denmark\u2019s suicide rate was 8.8 people per 100,000 (versus 12.1 per 100,000 in the United States) in 2012. WHO data from roughly a decade ago reported a suicide rate of 11.9 per 100,000 people in Denmark (versus 11.0 in the United States). While the U.S. and Denmark maintained similar rates of suicide per capita in years past, Denmark\u2019s suicide rate was markedly lower than that of the States by 2012 (and didn\u2019t appear to ever have been three times as high). Determining which percentage of the Danish population takes antidepressants is currently complicated by the fact that such data aren\u2019t readily available as standard metrics on health care reports. A 2013   Guardian article cited a survey conducted by Eurobarometer indicating that 93 percent of Danes reported never having taken antidepressants in their lives. Presumably, the remaining seven percent weren\u2019t all currently taking antidepressants, indicating the meme\u2019s claim was likely unsupported. OECD data from 2012 indicated that 85 doses of antidepressant medications were dispensed per thousand people per day (DDD) in Denmark. Directly comparable data from the United States with respect to DDD wasn\u2019t available (as that metric appears unique to Europe). Estimates suggest that between eight and eleven percent of [PDF] Americans are on antidepressants, and the 2013 study \u201cDepression and Antidepressants: A Nordic Perspective\u201d suggested fewer Danes than Americans took antidepressants at any given time (while maintaining that Nordic countries exhibited a higher rate of antidepressant use than Europe overall): The overall sales of antidepressant drugs in the Nordic countries in 2009 (74.1 DDD/1000 inhabitants per day) is [considerably] higher than the OECD average (52.5), but also higher than for example in the UK (60.9) (20). However, there are great variations between the countries, where Iceland by far has the highest level of antidepressant sales, almost double that in Norway. In total, approximately 2 million Nordic inhabitants were prescribed an antidepressant, almost a share of 8.5% at a total cost of \u20ac236 million according to latest available statistics (ranging from 2010 to 2012). Danish medical statistics shows that there were sales of antidepressants in 2011 of \u20ac68 million and over 460 000 Danes were prescribed an antidepressant (8.3% of the population) (21).        With respect to the claims made in the initial meme, it\u2019s (again) not entirely true that Danish schoolteachers earn $61,000 per year across the board. It\u2019s true that Danes are paid a stipend to go to university, and that college education is free for Danish students (and EU residents studying in that country). As indicated above, healthcare is often administered at no charge to Danes, depending on the service and their coverage status. And to reiterate, portions above addressed the prevalence of home ownership in Denmark, which is roughly equivalent to that of the U.S; personal ownership of vehicles is less common, but not by any means rare. As for vacation time, workers in Denmark are entitled to five paid weeks of it (as well as additional compensated time off totaling about nine days, from which the \u201csix weeks\u201d figure was most likely derived). Denmark\u2019s parental leave policies are among the most generous in the world, but 52 weeks (or one year) is on the upper end of leave with partial or total pay: The Danish parental leave system is among the most generous and flexible in the EU. Mothers are entitled to 4 weeks of maternity leave before the expected date of birth and 14 weeks of maternity leave after the birth. Fathers are entitled to 2 weeks of paternity leave within the first 14 weeks after the birth. Furthermore, each parent is entitled to 32 weeks of parental leave. Parents can receive maternity leave benefits from the State for a maximum of 52 weeks per child if they meet the employment criteria set out in the Maternity Leave Act. It\u2019s true that pension kicks in for Danes at the age of 65. The original meme claimed that the average American spent $8,500 per year in deductibles, while the Centers for Disease control placed average total spending per patient per year at $9,255 in 2013. We were unable to find a figure that specifically referenced \u201cdeductibles\u201d as a health care expenditure-related metric, but the number cited closely matched World Bank figures for per capita health expenditures. Cited college costs for students in the United States in the first meme weren\u2019t exaggerated either: data from 2014 place the yearly cost of tuition at a low of $18,943 (for in-state public schools) and a high of $42,419 (for out-of-state private schools). If it\u2019s surmised that three out of four students attend a local college at the cheaper tuition and one heads off to a private university, the average tuition between those four students would be $24,812. Finally, Denmark\u2019s novel \u201cflexicurity\u201d policy deviates from other European nations\u2019 worker protection policies (which are unlike American \u201cat will employment\u201d standards). While Danes can be more easily fired than those in other European countries, the country offers robust unemployment insurance compensation to level out labor market fluctuations. In short, it\u2019s true Denmark\u2019s taxes are far higher than those in the United States, but that\u2019s offset by significantly reduced costs to citizens for expenditures such as healthcare, education, and child care. A gallon of gas doesn\u2019t cost Danes anywhere near $10, but tax on new cars is 180%. We were unable to find any ranking of Denmark as the \u201chighest-taxed\u201d nation in the world (or even just Europe), and home ownership rates are near what they are in the U.S. (There are far more privately-owned vehicles in the United States than Denmark, however.) Denmark\u2019s suicide rate is lower than that of the U.S., and antidepressant usage is higher among Americans. Finally, while some young Danes moved abroad due to high taxes on income, we were unable to find any evidence that was the case for companies. "

    "claim": "A video shows Koko the gorilla spontaneously using sign language to issue a warning about climate change.",
    "content": " If you want an audience to take heed of what you have to say, sometimes the messenger who delivers it for you can be just as important as the message itself. Depending on the nature of your communiqu\u00e9, you may find it has a much greater impact on your intended audience if it is conveyed a a sympathetic figure who can tug at people\u2019s heartstrings (e.g., a child, a Native American, a mother, a veteran) or a respected figure whom viewers perceive as knowledgeable about the subject at hand (e.g., a judge, a policeman, a college professor). A messenger who brought both those qualities to the table was Koko the gorilla, a primate who purportedly understands approximately 2,000 words of the spoken human language and can communicate her thoughts to humans via her use of more than 1,000 signs of what \u2018Gorilla Sign Language\u2019 (a modified version of American Sign Language). In 2015 two non-profit organizations, the Gorilla Foundation (who oversee Koko\u2019s care and training), and NOE Conservation (who seek to safeguard biodiversity), teamed up to produce a Public Service Announcement (PSA) featuring Koko in conjunction with the United Nations Climate Change Conference (also known as the COP21 Climate Conference) held in Paris in December of that year:  That video captured Koko supposedly signing about the importance of our protecting and preserving nature, a message that (given the nature of the proceedings it was associated with) was interpreted as a plea to acknowledge the issue of climate change. The NOE said as much, declaring that the video captured \u201cKoko reacting after she has been informed about what is at stake at COP21.\u201d And the press release issued with the video by the Gorilla Foundation asserted that Koko was indeed being \u201cclear\u201d about wanting to convey the notion that \u201cMan is harming the Earth\u201d: Because of her unique ability to communicate with humans in sign language, Koko is a natural ambassador for endangered species, and thus we agreed to co-produce a short video PSA (Public Service Announcement) contingent on Koko\u2019s willingness to participate. Koko was clear about the main message: Man is harming the Earth and its many animal and plant species and needs to \u201churry\u201d and fix the problem.         We humans may disagree on the possibly deleterious effects our activities are having on our global environment, but how could we possibly ignore a poignant plea from a gorilla \u2014 a message delivered by a personification of Nature itself, who is not coincidentally regarded as sympathetic and knowledgeable regarding the subject at hand? Some viewers took the video a little too literally, however, and were surprised at Koko\u2019s pithy and timely exhortation to heed the perils of global warming. But nothing about the video indicates that Koko can actually entertain, much less communicate to humans, thoughts about environmentalism. For starters, as noted in a 2014 Slate, human-ape communication may be far more about anthropomorphization than actual linguistic expression, especially when it comes to the expressing ideas rather than communicating basic needs: [C]onceding that the scientific jury is still out on whether gorillas are capable of sophisticated emotions doesn\u2019t make headlines, and admitting the ambiguity inherent in interpreting a gorilla\u2019s sign language doesn\u2019t bring in millions of dollars in donations. So we get a story about Koko mourning Robin Williams: a nice, straightforward tale that warms the heart but leaves scientists and skeptics wondering how a gorilla\u2019s emotions can be deduced so easily. Koko is perhaps the most famous product of an ambitious field of research, one that sought from the outset to examine whether apes and humans could communicate. In dozens of studies, scientists raised apes with humans and attempted to teach them language. Dedicated researchers brought apes like Koko into their homes or turned their labs into home-like environments where people and apes could play together and try, often awkwardly, to understand each other. The researchers made these apes the center of their lives. But the research didn\u2019t deliver on its promise. No new studies have been launched in years, and the old ones are fizzling out. A behind-the-scenes look at what remains of this research today reveals a surprisingly dramatic world of lawsuits, mass resignations, and dysfunctional relationships between humans and apes. Unlike us, it seems that apes don\u2019t care to chitchat. Psychologist Susan Goldin-Meadow points out that studies with Kanzi (a bonobo) show that only 4 percent of his signs are commentary, meaning the other 96 percent are all functional signs, asking for food or toys. Similar skepticism about Koko emerged in the 1980s, when Herb Terrace published a fairly scathing critique of ape language research. Among other criticisms, Terrace asserted that Koko\u2019s signs were not spontaneous but instead elicited by [her handler\u2019s] asking her questions. In any case, Koko\u2019s supposed message about climate change and biodiversity is completely lacking in context: the viewer has no idea what any offscreen handlers might have said or done to elicit the signing she produces, or whether the video is anything more than a collection of disjoint, completely unrelated signs strung together into a narrative fashioned by humans rather than a gorilla. Even if we were to assume the (highly unlikely) possibility that Koko\u2019s signing was completely spontaneous and unguided, her \u201cmessage\u201d is highly ambiguous and non-specific \u2014 outside of humans\u2019 suggesting a framework for us to employ in interpreting it: I am gorilla. I am flowers, animals. I am nature. Man Koko love. Earth Koko love. But Man stupid. Stupid! Koko sorry. Koko cry. Time hurry! Fix Earth! Help Earth! Hurry! Protect Earth. Nature see you. Thank you. For all we know, this discourse might have been prompted by Koko\u2019s having just witnessed a clumsy gardener on a power mower carelessly amputating a crop of blooming roses in a nearby flowerbed, and she\u2019s expressing that she wants someone to repair the damage by reattaching the severed buds to their stems. Even the Gorilla Foundation admitted that Koko was \u201cbriefed\u201d on the subject at hand and provided with a \u201cscript\u201d for the video, which was \u201cedited from a number of separate takes\u201d: Turns out Koko was very interested in the subject [of preserving biodiversity], which we briefed her on via a recent issue of National Geographic titled \u201cCool It!\u201d We also presented her with a script drafted by NOE (as any celebrity ambassador asked to do a PSA would expect) and allowed her to improvise during s series of brief daily video discussion sessions, in which Koko also had to learn a few new signs, such as \u201cProtect\u201d and \u201cNature.\u201d The resulting PSA was edited from a number of separate takes, for brevity and continuity.        Barbara King, a biological anthropologist at the College of William and Mary who writes about human evolution, primate behavior, and the cognition and emotion of animals, commented on the the Koko PSA thusly for NPR: [R]eminds me of earlier attempts by the Gorilla Foundation to showcase Koko\u2019s ability to understand things that there\u2019s little chance she could understand, at least in the ways suggested. Anthropomorphism \u2014 the projection of so-called human qualities onto other animals \u2014 is not inevitably wrong. Other animals may share with us many ways of thinking and feeling, and recognizing that fact is often appropriate. But the anthropomorphism in this video is not appropriate. Not even linguistically inclined apes comprehend anything close to the dynamic interplay between humans and nature that underlies anthropogenic climate change. King also quoted Sherman Wilcox, professor of linguistics at the University of New Mexico, as saying in reaction to this video: This is obviously a doctored video composed of highly edited clips of single signs pieced together to make it look like Koko is actually saying something, when she\u2019s not. It is disconcerting on so many levels. I fear it diminishes the seriousness of the climate change issue. Climate change deniers already feel like scientists are lying to the public. We don\u2019t need to give them fake videos. A Huffington Post article on the topic similarly quoted skeptics from the fields of linguistics and primate research: But can a gorilla really grasp abstract concepts like climate change and biodiversity? \u201cOf course not,\u201d Herbert Terrace, director of Columbia University\u2019s Primate Cognition Lab, told The Huffington Post. Terrace criticized the video as \u201chighly misleading\u201d because \u201cwe don\u2019t know what Koko\u2019s trainer was signing to her before she uttered the various signs \u2026 attributed to her.\u201d Frans de Waal, director of Emory University\u2019s Living Links primate research center, suggested that the conservation video hurts the credibility of those who study animal intelligence. \u201cKoko\u2019s human-coached message goes well beyond anything that a gorilla understands or cares about, such as human global impact,\u201d de Waal told HuffPost. He added that \u201cstunts\u201d like this one \u201chave given the ape-language field a bad name, whereas there is so much more to discover if we just study what cognitively advanced animals can do of their own accord.\u201d \u201cThe problem comes in when we take an ape\u2019s accomplishments and then \u2026 insist \u2026 on putting her forward as a wise old woman, and she\u2019s not,\u201d [Barbara] King said. The Koko climate change PSA is a novel and compelling way of focusing viewer attention on a political message, but it\u2019s basically just a staged commercial, not an expression of sagacity about Nature issued by a non-human creature.

After a 9 January 2016 drawing failed to produce a winner (and sent the jackpot amount soaring even higher), memes began circulating similar to the above-reproduced image.

The meme went on to assert that the problem of poverty could be \u201csolved\u201d by this division (irrespective of the inevitable economic adjustments that would occur should every American suddenly become four million dollars richer). Alas, the math presented in the meme was wildly off from real math. If $1.3 billion were divided among the current American population of roughly 322,820,000 \u2026 we\u2019d all get approximately $4.02 (almost enough for a Grande \u2014 that is to say, medium \u2014 beverage at Starbucks). Although the meme proved popular in a time of increased Powerball jackpot interest, its claims didn\u2019t illustrate how simple solving the problem of poverty in America might be if Powerball proceeds were distributed to everyone rather than paid to a handful of winners. The misconception was similar to a viral July 2015 debate regarding the math of Obamacare:  1 million dollars to 300 million people is only 300 million dollars  "

    "content": " On 17 June 2018, right-wing blogs published a flurry of stories reporting that the administration of former United States President Barack Obama had handed immigrant children over to human traffickers. The reports were posted in response to the public outcry over a policy enacted by Obama\u2019s successor, Donald Trump, whose administration in April 2018 announced a \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy. Under this policy, all adults who are caught crossing the southern U.S. border between ports of entry are being charged with federal crimes and then separated from accompanying children.  As the policy went into effect, news reports documenting scenes of distraught, traumatized children being torn from their parents by immigration authorities, and images migrant children being held in cages, created a backlash from both sides of the political spectrum against the Trump administration. In response to the growing fallout, the president\u2019s supporters wrote up stories criticizing his predecessor based on a 2015 criminal case and 2016 Senate report stemming from a Marion, Ohio human trafficking ring that used migrant children for forced labor on an egg farm. Right-leaning blogs like WesternJournal.com\u2019s Conservative Tribune for example confusingly reported the media was \u201csilent\u201d about the case while aggregating their story from a New York Magazine report: The left-leaning media stayed strangely silent when the detention of migrant children went on for years before Trump took office\u2026 and now it looks like they also kept quiet when Barack Obama\u2019s administration literally placed immigrant children in the hands of human traffickers just a few years ago. \u201cThe United States government placed an unknown number of Central American migrant children into the custody of human traffickers after neglecting to run the most basic checks on these so-called \u2018caregivers,\u2019\u201d New York magazine  reported in 2016, based on a Senate report.         It\u2019s an obviously false statement that the \u201cleft-leaning media stayed strangely silent\u201d about the case, because a simple Google search reveals it has been thoroughly reported on by local and national outlets and is the subject of a PBS documentary film. As the text notes, Conservative Tribune\u2019s own story was based on such reporting.  In July 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted a ring of traffickers led by Aroldo Castillo-Serrano and accused them of smuggling children into the United States. They were also accused of lying to Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) by posing as relatives in order to gain custody of children in its care and use them for forced labor in Marion, a city north of Columbus. The federal indictment, filed in U.S. district court in Ohio accuses Castillo-Serrano and his conspirators of forcing the children to live in squalid trailers and work six or seven 12-hour days a week, using threats and physical violence as coercion. According to the Justice Department, Castillo-Serrano pleaded guilty in August 2015 to counts related to trafficking. He was sentenced to more than 15 years in prison and ordered to pay restitution to the victims. The case spurred a Senate subcommittee investigation led by Rob Portman (R-Ohio) which concluded the processes used by ORR to screen sponsors \u201care inadequate to protect the children in the agency\u2019s care.\u201d At the time, HHS lacked a system to screen potential sponsors for signs of trafficking, like accumulating multiple unrelated children. It did not physically assess homes children were being placed in and did not do adequate background checks on adults residing in those homes. The report found that in 2014, \u201cHHS permitted a sponsor to block a child-welfare case worker from visiting with one of the victims, even after the case worker discovered the child was not living at the address on file with HHS.\u201d As a result of the investigation, HHS and the Department of Homeland Security entered into an agreement to hammer out a joint plan that would address the issues raised in the report. As of 26 April 2018, that still had not happened according to Portman, who released a statement blasting the agencies for their failure to take action. He wrote: The agreement said the agencies would enter into a detailed \u201cJoint Concept of Operations\u201d that would spell out what the agencies would do to fix the problems. They gave themselves a deadline of February 2017. That was over a year ago. It\u2019s now April 2018. We still don\u2019t have that Joint Concept of Operations \u2014 the JCO \u2014 and despite repeated questions from Sen. Carper and me, as well as our staffs, over the past year, we don\u2019t have any answers about why that is. In fact, in a recent meeting, a DHS official asked our investigators why we even cared about the JCO. The issue of HHS\u2019s lack of accountability for unaccompanied immigrant children came to a head in May 2018 when HHS acting assistant secretary of Administration for Children and Families Steven Wagner told a Senate oversight committee that the agency could not account for 1,475 children it had placed with sponsors from October to December 2017. The furor over that story accompanied outrage over the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, with critics raising concerns that the federal government was unnecessarily overwhelming an already-overburdened system with traumatized children. To make matters worse, an investigation published 19 June 2018 by McClatchy revealed that the figure was only a snapshot from a three-month period and the number of children who are unaccounted for by HHS is actually nearly 6,000. The figure is likely exacerbated by an April 2018 agreement that allows background check information, including immigration status, of caregivers like parents and relatives to be shared with immigration authorities. McClatchy reported: The new estimate comes as backlash widens over President Donald Trump\u2019s\u2019 decision to separate parents and children. Advocates argue the growing numbers of unaccounted children should be expected as families and sponsors become more fearful of federal officials that is now using information from government social workers to run immigration checks and, in some cases, target sponsors, including parents and family members, for removal. We have reached out to HHS with a number of questions regarding the care of newly-separated children and the method with which they will be tracked and eventually reunited with parents. We have not received a response. "
