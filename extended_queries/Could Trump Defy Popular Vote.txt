    "claim": "As of mid-November, several battleground states had not certified results of the popular vote in the 2020 presidential race, which meant U.S. President Donald Trump had an opportunity to defy the election's outcome.",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. In mid-November 2020, after U.S. Democrat Joe Biden secured the majority of the country\u2019s electoral votes in the presidential race against President Donald Trump, an email from the sitting president\u2019s campaign to supporters implied that the country\u2019s constitutionally mandated elections process allowed time for Trump to defy the outcome of the popular vote. (Read more fact checks like this one here.) \u201cJoe Biden has NOT been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or any states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor,\u201d read a Nov. 13 Trump fundraising email obtained by Snopes.  The email alleged that states had not certified results of the 2020 election and Trump\u2019s political enemies were wrongfully trying to convince Americans that a Biden presidency was inevitable when it wasn\u2019t.         The claim was two-pronged: Key battleground states had not certified results of the popular vote, and because of that Trump had a chance to defy its outcome. First, let\u2019s define what step in the country\u2019s election process \u2014 which functions under the Constitution, federal statutes, and state laws \u2014 to which the campaign was referring. Every four years in America, people submit ballots in a popular vote for the president. Most states grant counties the authority to administer those elections via a board of electors, an election official or officials, or both. Those local jurisdictions operate under varying timelines for processing votes. As they begin to publish unofficial voter tallies via secretary of state websites or other government-run databases on election night, statisticians compare the sum of votes counted to the difference in totals between the losing and winning candidate. When there appears to be no statistical chance for a losing candidate to overcome the competitor in a state, journalists \u201ccall\u201d the race and project a winner there. As a result, that candidate receives that state\u2019s total number of electoral votes. In the Trump-Biden contest, the news media did not announce a winner in several states until days after polls closed, in part, due to an unprecedented surge in mail-in voting and states\u2019 varying rules for when they can start processing those ballots. See National Public Radio\u2019s graphic showing deadlines below, based on data from state elections offices, the National League for State Legislatures, and Ballotpedia:  On Nov. 7, however, Biden secured the majority of the country\u2019s electoral votes (again, based on unofficial voter tallies), and was announced the 46th President of the United States.        Historically, it is that point in the election process \u2014 when ballots haven\u2019t been certified at the county or state level \u2014 that a losing candidate concedes defeat. That acknowledgment, while not constitutionally required, has come to represent a losing candidates\u2019 willingness to help the winner transition\u2019s into the White House. It also serves to help the losing candidate\u2019s supporters accept the election\u2019s outcome. Cue the above-mentioned claim about Trump having a chance at another term and that the election\u2019s \u201cultimate victor\u201d was yet to be decided. The Associated Press reported: Certifying results is a routine yet important step after local election officials have tallied votes, reviewed procedures, checked to ensure votes were counted correctly and investigated discrepancies. Typically, this certification is done by a local board of elections and then, later, the results are certified at the state level. But as Trump has refused to concede to Biden and continues to spread false claims of victory, this mundane process is taking on new significance. Under state and federal laws, the process of cementing voter tallies continues regardless of a candidate\u2019s acceptance of the popular vote. First, local election boards certify ballots at a precinct level. After that, state executive authorities seal state\u2019s results via a \u201cCertificate of Ascertainment\u201d \u2014 a document that lists the names of the state\u2019s chosen electors who will cast official votes for president through the Electoral College. (State legislatures decide how to appoint electors and their necessary qualifications.) Deadlines for completing certifications vary state by state under local laws. According to MIT Technology Review, such dates for battleground states were: Georgia\u2019s certification deadline is November 20.  Pennsylvania counties must submit certification by November 23.  Michigan\u2019s certification deadline is November 23. Nevada\u2019s certification deadline is November 24.  Arizona\u2019s certification deadline is November 30. Wisconsin\u2019s certification deadline is December 1. Once completed, governors submit their \u201cCertificate of Ascertainment\u201d to the U.S. Archivist. The electors listed on the document then meet at state capitals to formally cast their votes for president and vice president on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, per guidelines outlined in the Constitution. In 2020, that\u2019s Dec. 14.        In other words, it was accurate to state, as of mid-November, several battleground states had not certified results of the popular vote, including Georgia, where the state\u2019s Republican secretary of state ordered a manual recount of ballots and Biden led by a slim margin of 0.3 percentage points. However, less clear was whether that fact meant Trump had a chance to overturn Biden\u2019s victory. Via lawsuits and campaign messages to supporters, like the above-displayed fundraising email, the Trump campaign was trying to convince Americans that governments should hold off on certifying ballots because widespread voter fraud tainted the numbers, even though no evidence showed that was true. Matt Morgan, the Trump campaign\u2019s general counsel, said the push to try to delay or stop voter certification in battleground states aimed to give the campaign more time to get a handle on voter tallies and whether it would have the right to automatic recounts, according to The Associated Press. Additionally, some Trump allies wanted to slow down the process to give GOP-controlled legislatures an opportunity to pick a slate of electors who would overturn Biden\u2019s victory through the Electoral College or send the election to the U.S. House of Representatives. (Read here for how Congress would decide the outcome of the 2020 election, pending what happens with the Electoral College.) As of this writing, two Republican election officials in Michigan\u2019s Wayne County had refused to certify results of the popular vote, citing the unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud, and then reversed course on Nov. 17. GOP officials in Arizona were also trying to pressure county officials to delay the process, per news reports. Simultaneously, Trump allies in Michigan and Nevada pushed lawsuits attempting to stop voter certification. University of Kentucky Law Professor Joshua Douglas told The Associated Press there was no precedent for such an effort to delay or undermine the typically sleepy step in the country\u2019s presidential elections. \u201cIt would be the end of democracy as we know it,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cThis is just not a thing that can happen.\u201d We should note here: The emails from Trump\u2019s campaign about states certifying voting results asked supporters to chip in to a so-called \u201cOfficial Election Defense Fund\u201d or \u201cElection Defense Task Force,\u201d both of which the campaign framed as costly initiatives involving ballot recounts or various lawsuits to challenge Biden\u2019s win. But according to Brendan Fischer, director of the federal reform program at Campaign Legal Center, the average donor\u2019s money was not covering those expenses. Rather, people were giving their money to the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, where contributions are divided between Trump\u2019s committees and the Republican National Committee.  \u201cSmall donors who give to Trump thinking they are financing an \u2018official election defense fund\u2019 are in fact helping pay down the Trump campaign\u2019s debt or funding his post-presidential political operation,\u201d Fischer tweeted. In sum, while it was true to claim states had not certified results of the popular vote, the resulting success of the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to intervene in that typically procedural step remained unknown at the time of this writing, and it was erroneous to claim that a winner of the election had not been named. For those reasons, we rate the allegation in the fundraising email a \u201cmixture\u201d of accurate, undetermined, and false information. "

    "claim": "As of mid-November 2020, the U.S. presidential election remained \"far from over,\" thus enough uncertainty about the outcome remained that U.S. President Donald Trump could reasonably claim he might still be the winner.",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. In mid-November 2020, after all major news organizations declared former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden the winner of the presidential election, President Donald Trump\u2018s campaign claimed in a series of fundraising emails that the election was \u201cfar from over,\u201d and that supporters should not believe messages to the contrary. (Read more fact checks like this one here.) In other words, the emails claimed either Biden or Trump could serve as the country\u2019s 46th president come Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, 2021 \u2014 even though Biden won key battleground states, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, by comfortable vote margins and exceeded the 270 Electoral College votes required to win the presidency.  The emails \u2014 like the president\u2019s tweets that falsely claimed he had won or denied Biden\u2019s victory \u2014 were part of an aggressive disinformation campaign attempting to attack the integrity of America\u2019s democratic process and convince supporters that Trump had a significant chance to serve another term.         \u201cJoe Biden only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING. We have a long way to go \u2014 this was a flawed ELECTION,\u201d said a Nov. 19 campaign email obtained by Snopes.  To unpack the underlying claim \u2014 that American elections provide losing candidates an opportunity to defy the outcome of the popular vote \u2014 let\u2019s first lay out the country\u2019s steps for presidential elections under the Constitution, federal statutes, and state laws. Every four years, when Americans cast ballots in presidential elections, they are participating in the country\u2019s popular vote. That happened Nov. 3 in the Trump-Biden race. Days later on Nov. 7, Biden was announced the winner of the popular vote based on the number of votes counted so far compared to the margin of votes between him and Trump in key battleground states. (Read why and how journalists make that determination in presidential races here.) Typically, at that point in an election, the losing candidate acknowledges defeat by conceding to his opponent and addressing supporters in a speech. But Trump not only did not do that, he and his allies went a step further by spewing the unfounded conspiracy theory that any person or group who acknowledged  Biden\u2019s victory was working to undermine the president. Whether a candidate accepts the outcome of the popular vote or not, state officials at polling sites nationwide continue to count remaining ballots over the course of days or weeks, according to their respective rules. That process, which historically is a procedural step to cement the outcome of the popular vote, requires governors to prepare what\u2019s called a \u201cCertificate of Ascertainment\u201d that lists their state\u2019s slate of electors. For example, Biden won the popular vote in Minnesota, so that\u2019s state\u2019s certificate would list 10 Democratic electors who pledged to vote for Biden through the Electoral College.        Likewise, if, hypothetically, Trump had won the Midwestern state, the state\u2019s certificate would list a different group of 10 people \u2014 electors who pledged to vote for the Republican candidate. All of this said, electors meet at state capitals in early December, weeks after Election Day, to formally cast votes for president and vice president, per guidelines outlined in the Constitution. No constitutional provision, nor any federal law, requires electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote; however, the majority of states and the District of Columbia have their own laws governing the Electoral College and aim to keep electors from defying the popular vote. Here are specific deadlines for those above-described steps in presidential elections, per The Associated Press: Dec. 8 is the deadline for resolving election disputes at the state level. All state recounts and court contests over presidential election results are to be completed by this date. Dec. 14: Electors vote by paper ballot in their respective states and the District of Columbia. Thirty-three states and D.C. have laws or party regulations requiring electors to vote the same way the popular vote goes in the state, and in some states, electors can even be replaced or subjected to penalties, according to the Congressional Research Service. Dec. 23: The certificates must be delivered to the designated officials. If they are not delivered, the law provides alternative avenues for getting the results to Washington. Jan. 6, 2021: The House and Senate hold a joint session to count the electoral votes. If one ticket has received 270 or more electoral votes, the president of the Senate, currently Vice President Mike Pence, announces the results. So, in short, a presidential election doesn\u2019t end on Election Day, nor when a candidate is projected the winner by news media. Rather, presidential elections officially conclude the following year, in January. But it\u2019s a false interpretation of state and federal laws governing presidential elections to consider those continuing steps after polls close on Election Day \u2014 when states certify results or choose electors, or the Electoral College votes for president \u2014 as opportunities to defy the popular vote. Per analysis of the guidelines by constitutional experts and election academics, the post-election day procedures mainly serve to cement what voters decided at the county and state level. We should note here: The emails from Trump\u2019s campaign alleging the election was \u201cfar from over\u201d asked supporters to chip in to a so-called \u201cOfficial Election Defense Fund\u201d or \u201cElection Defense Task Force,\u201d both of which the campaign framed as costly initiatives involving ballot recounts or various lawsuits to challenge Biden\u2019s win. But according to Brendan Fischer, director of the federal reform program at Campaign Legal Center, the average donor\u2019s money was not covering those expenses.  \u201cSmall donors who give to Trump thinking they are financing an \u2018official election defense fund\u2019 are in fact helping pay down the Trump campaign\u2019s debt or funding his post-presidential political operation,\u201d Fischer tweeted. In sum, it was accurate to claim the 2020 presidential election was incomplete as of mid-November. However, it was false to categorize the remaining procedures as reasonable opportunities for Trump to overturn Biden\u2019s victory. For those reasons, we rate this claim \u201cMostly False.\u201d "

    "claim": "In Georgia's U.S. Senate runoff election on Jan. 5, 2021, a majority of write-in ballots for Trump would elect him to the U.S. Senate, or alternatively, undermine Republican candidates.",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. In late November 2020, after U.S. President-elect Joe Biden secured the battleground state of Georgia in the presidential election, a social media campaign emerged claiming his opponent, U.S. President Donald Trump, would have a chance to serve in the U.S. Senate if enough people voted for him in the state\u2019s upcoming runoffs. The Jan. 5, 2021, runoff election between incumbent Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue and Democrats the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff will decide whether Republicans or Democrats control the upper chamber at the outset of a Biden administration. Georgia election rules call for runoff races when no candidate exceeds 50% of voter share in either race during the general election.  But with the hashtag #WriteInTrumpForGA on platforms including Twitter and Parler, an online haven for conservatives, posts attempted to convince Georgia voters to write in Trump\u2019s name and elect him to the Senate, even though he was not a candidate.  \u201cWe need to cover ALL bases in our stop the steal efforts, and one of these is simply utilizing our voice for the GA runoffs and writing in Donald J Trump for senate,\u201d read one Parler post. \u201c[We] can maintain a senate majority with TRUMP as the majority leader! We can put a STOP to the democrats!\u201d         The underlying message of some posts echoed Trump\u2019s attacks on Georgia Republican state officials who oversaw the process for certifying votes in the presidential race. In tweets and emails to supporters soliciting donations, the Trump campaign called on Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to break state laws governing the democratic process and defy the outcome of the popular vote that awarded Georgia\u2019s 16 electoral votes to Biden. He won by fewer than 13,000 votes out of about 5 million cast. Some Parler posts obtained by Snopes, such as the ones displayed below, lumped Senate candidates Loeffler and Perdue into that group of Republicans who were not acceding to the Trump campaign\u2019s requests to delegitimize Biden\u2019s win by spreading baseless allegations that Dominion Voting Systems software had altered votes.   \u201cThe president has basically taken hostage this race,\u201d said Brendan Buck, once a top adviser to former House Speaker Paul Ryan, per The Associated Press. In short, some posts wanted Georgia voters to write in Trump\u2019s name to supposedly help him win a Senate seat. Meanwhile, others promoted the #WriteInTrumpForGA campaign not to necessarily elect Trump but to \u201cpunish\u201d Loeffler and Perdue, since participating voters would, in theory, otherwise have voted for the Senate Republican candidates. The assumption behind the former approach \u2014 that Trump had a realistic chance to serve in the Senate \u2014 was false, but the latter reasoning had some validity to it, which we explain below. First, though, let us lay out laws governing runoff elections. Georgia is one of 10 U.S. states where statutes require runoff elections when no candidate receives more than 50% of votes in a general election. Per Georgia Code Title 21. Elections \u00a7 21-2-501:        \u201cIn instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, a run-off primary, special primary runoff, run-off election, or special election runoff between the candidates receiving the two highest numbers of votes shall be held.\u201d That means, per state law, all runoffs in Georgia only allow two candidates (the top two vote-getters in general elections) per race on ballots. So in the Jan. 5 Georgia runoffs, ballots allow voters the options of selecting either Loeffler or Warnock in one race, or Perdue or Ossoff in the other (see the sample ballot below). There is no line allocated for a write-in option, no matter if people cast paper ballots or use touch-screen voting.   An Attempt To \u2018Tilt The Balance In Trump\u2019s Favor\u2019 Nonetheless, people in theory could still answer the social media campaign\u2019s request to write in Trump\u2019s name on ballots unofficially, perhaps in the paper\u2019s margins or next to the Senate candidates\u2019 names. But that scribbling would not be an official vote for the sitting president (or anyone) for numerous reasons. Namely, as stated, Trump was not among the top two vote-getters in Georgia\u2019s Senate races, so the law does not consider him a viable candidate in the runoffs.  Additionally, since the ballots do not include an official line for write-in candidates, writing outside of the bubbles for official candidates could force election officials to invalidate the paperwork all together, per laws governing the ballot-counting process. The statutes require poll workers to scan ballots for improper markings or other defects before they feed them into tabulation machines for official vote counts. As a result, spoiled or defective ballots are not legally counted in elections.        Given that fact, opponents of Trump co-opted #WriteInTrumpForGA in attempt to help Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia. If a significant number of Republican voters wrote Trump on their ballots \u2014 and, as a result, election officials had to invalidate their votes under state law \u2014 the race\u2019s Democratic candidates could reap the benefit, and Republicans could risk losing a Senate majority.  That communications strategy to convince die-hard conservatives that voting for Loeffler and Perdue would defy Trump\u2019s political agenda (cryptically in the name of helping Democrats) manifested in other ways, too. An anti-Trump political organization called \u201cReally American PAC\u201d was supposedly soliciting donations on ActBlue, a fundraising processor for Democratic campaigns, to pay for the billboards displayed below. At least one Twitter user claimed to have seen one of the signs in real life. \u201cIf Trump supporters deliver Perdue and Loeffler a victory, they should be acutely aware that they will be delivering Trump and MAGA a serious political defeat,\u201d read a statement by the PAC.  A website, writeintrumpforgeorgiasenate.com, was also part of that tongue-in-cheek campaign effort, per an attorney for an opposing political action group. The website read:         \u201cWith enough write-ins in the Georgia senate race, we can tilt the balance in Georgia in Trump\u2019s favor! If we can do this, we have a real chance at getting these RINO senators to act on the illegitimate and corrupt election presided over by a Democrat party that is invested in the Communist takeover of Our Great Nation. \u201d The site says it was funded by the political group \u201cCommittee for American Sovereignty,\u201d which according to news reports was created in 2016 to help Republican operatives \u2014 including Trump\u2019s longtime political confidant Roger Stone \u2014 undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign by spewing an unfounded conspiracy theory that Bill Clinton had an illegitimate biracial son. The Daily Beast, however, reported that Paul Jensen, an attorney for the committee, refuted its connection to the website, and alleged its \u201cgoal is to elect the Democrat candidate, suggesting that a Democrat-leaning entity, not the Committee for American Sovereignty, is behind it.\u201d Effects of Political Communication Schemes Remain Unknown On Nov. 23, Donald Trump Jr. refuted the messages urging Trump supporters to abstain from voting for Loeffler and Perdue.  More than a week later, as Trump prepared for a Dec. 5 visit to Georgia to campaign alongside Perdue and Loeffler, the president echoed that sentiment, saying in a tweet \u201cwe must work hard\u201d to ensure victories for the Republican Senate candidates.  In sum, the outcome of the runoffs remained unknown; therefore, it was unclear how any ballots, much less those with invalid markings for Trump, would impact results. But if, instead of voting for Loeffler or Perdue, a significant number of Republican voters unofficially wrote Trump\u2019s name on their ballots \u2014 and, as a result, election officials had to throw out those ballots\u2014 Democrats\u2019 vote margins would benefit. Depending on the level of participation in that protest, it could undermine Senate Republicans\u2019 chance at securing the chamber\u2019s majority. Nonetheless, state and federal laws governing elections would not allow voters the opportunity to elect Trump to the Senate in the runoffs. For those reasons, we rate this claim \u201cMostly false.\u201d "

    "claim": "State legislatures can override the results of elections and designate whichever presidential electors they choose. ",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. As Americans exhaustively discuss (and often lament) in every presidential election year, the United States does not choose its chief executive based on whichever candidate receives the largest number of votes in a national election, but via an electoral college system under which each of the individual states holds a separate election to select a slate of electors who cast their votes for president. This unique approach means that sometimes \u2014 as happened in 2000 and again in 2016 \u2014 the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide does not ultimately win the overall election. When that phenomenon occurs (and sometimes even when it doesn\u2019t), partisans of the losing candidate start ruminating about ways to \u201cgame\u201d the electoral college system to install their preferred choice in the White House regardless. One example of this trend\u2019s playing out in 2020, when U.S. President Donald Trump apparently lost both the popular and the electoral vote, yet he, and many of his supporters, claimed victory nonetheless and asserted claims (without credible evidence) that substantial election fraud had taken place. Some voices proclaimed that states in which Republicans controlled the state legislature should choose electors favoring Trump, no matter how the residents of those states may have voted:  REMINDER TO THE REPUBLICAN STATE LEGISLATURES, YOU HAVE THE FINAL SAY OVER THE CHOOSING OF ELECTORS, NOT ANY BOARD OF ELECTIONS, SECRETARY OF STATE, GOVERNOR, OR EVEN COURT. YOU HAVE THE FINAL SAY \u2014 ARTICLE II OF THE FED CONSTITUTION. SO, GET READY TO DO YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY \u2014 Mark R. Levin (@marklevinshow) November 5, 2020          The scheme proposed here reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how the U.S. electoral college system and electoral law function, however. When the framers of the U.S. Constitution outlined the workings of the electoral college system, they didn\u2019t specify how presidential electors should or must be chosen, leaving it up to the various state legislatures to each decide for themselves how to appoint their electors: \u201cEach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress \u2026\u201d This passage meant that state legislatures could opt to choose electors themselves, or appoint a commission to designate electors, or hold a lottery, or flip a coin, or employ whatever other method they saw fit. However, it does not mean that, as suggested by the above tweet, state legislatures now have carte blanche to simply ignore election results and choose whichever presidential electors they want. After the U.S. Constitution was ratified and went into effect in 1788, states generally used a combination of selection by legislatures and selection by popular vote for designating their electors. By 1864, though, every state had adopted laws establishing the practice of popular voting for electors. For the most part, each political party submits a list of electors who are pledged to vote for that party\u2019s candidate to state elections officials, and after the election the state appoints the electors submitted by the party of whichever presidential candidate received the most votes. The website of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) describes this process: The U.S. Constitution does not specify procedures for the nomination of candidates for presidential elector. The two most common methods the states have adopted are nomination by state party convention and by state party committee. Generally, the parties select members known for their loyalty and service to the party, such as party leaders, state and local elected officials and party activists. In some states, the electors\u2019 names appear on the ballot along with the names of the candidates for president and vice president. However, in most states, electors\u2019 names are not printed on the ballot. When a voter casts a vote for a candidate for President of the United States, s/he is in actuality casting a vote for the presidential electors who were selected by that candidate\u2019s party. [W]hen a candidate for president wins a state\u2019s popular vote, that party\u2019s slate of electors will be the ones to cast the vote for president of the United States in December. For example, Florida has 29 electoral votes. If President Donald Trump wins the state\u2019s popular vote on Nov. 3, the 29 electors nominated by the Republican Party in Florida will be selected. These 29 people will gather on Dec. 14 to cast their votes for president of the United States. Although the wording of Article II of the Constitution (quoted above) allows that any state\u2019s legislature could opt for a different method of picking electors in the future, it does not empower any legislature to ignore both their state\u2019s elections results and their existing laws and, willy-nilly, designate whomever they want as electors. (In reference to the NCSL passage quoted above, for example, Democratic legislators in Florida could not decline to recognize Donald Trump as the winner in that state\u2019s election and appoint electors chosen by the Democratic party instead.) Any state\u2019s legislature could, theoretically, pass a law setting out a new method for designating presidential electors other than popular vote. However, they would have enact such a law prior to Election Day; they could not retroactively change, or just disregard, their current laws to defy the will of voters. State election laws and regulations must be established and in place prior to Election Day \u2014 they cannot be improvised or instituted on an ad hoc basis after the fact. Otherwise, every presidential election would descend into chaos, with state legislatures controlled by one party refusing to appoint electors pledged to the other party\u2019s candidate, as the Lawfare blog observed: The legal theory that would allow state legislatures to go rogue and appoint electors without regard for the popular vote rests on an argument made by Chief Justice William Rehnquist in Bush v. Gore, for himself and two other justices. On this view, a legislature is unconstrained in its power to set the manner by which electors are selected \u2014 meaning that even after an election, the legislature could ignore the results and select a different slate altogether. A recent opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggests that Rehnquist\u2019s argument may be again on the rise. But advocates for this view need to recognize that between Bush v. Gore and today, the Supreme Court has unanimously decided that presidential electors are not actually \u201celectors\u201d but are instead bound to the people\u2019s vote. That principle that cabins elector discretion must also constrain legislatures \u2014 at least if the country is to avoid an abomination that the Framers expressly rejected. That said, the law is only relevant to the extent that is it enforceable. If Republican-dominated legislatures were determined to find excuses for ignoring their states\u2019 election results, a Republican-controlled Senate were willing to facilitate the scheme, and a conservative judiciary were compliant in upholding the results, then such a plot might indeed succeed.

    "claim": "The Trump administration's approval of the presidential transition process means Trump has conceded the 2020 election to Joe Biden.",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. On Nov. 23, 2020, U.S. General Services Administrator Emily Murphy \u2014 an appointee of President Donald Trump \u2014 wrote a letter to President-elect Joe Biden that allowed him to start a formal transition of power. The paperwork, obtained by Snopes and displayed below, was the first formal recognition by Trump\u2019s government of a Biden presidency. The document from the head of the General Services Administration (GSA), an executive branch agency that oversees presidential transitions, raised questions about whether it meant that Trump himself acknowledged defeat to Biden. Concession statements to Americans or phone calls to winning candidates represent an informal step in the country\u2019s election process that typically occurs when one candidate secures the majority of electoral votes. Biden reached that milestone \u2014 winning key battleground states, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, by comfortable margins \u2014 weeks before Murphy\u2019s letter. However, Trump broke democratic norms by refusing to concede publicly.          Instead, the president\u2019s campaign filed a barrage of lawsuits in local jurisdictions across the country and accelerated a misinformation campaign online that denied or falsely presented the election results. While legal experts said the litigation did not contain enough evidence to reverse Biden\u2019s win, Trump\u2019s supporters viewed the effort as a commendable, tough, not-going-to-back-down approach to electoral politics. \u201cIt is not a stain on our national honor for a candidate to refuse to concede when there are open and compelling disputes about an electoral outcome,\u201d read a Nov. 23 statement by supporters of the Conservative Action Project, an initiative founded by former Attorney General Edwin Meese III. Despite not receiving Trump\u2019s concession, Biden filled his Cabinet for the White House, addressing the country under the \u201cOffice of the President Elect,\u201d and states certified results of the popular vote in order to begin the process of voting for president through the Electoral College. Cue Murphy\u2019s letter on Nov. 23. The document carried out the government\u2019s obligation under the 1963 Presidential Transition Act to allow presidents-elect and their appointees, aids, and other staff \u2014 otherwise known as a transition team \u2014 to access millions of federal dollars and set up White House operations before swearing-in ceremonies that would take place the January after general elections.   Murphy submitted the paperwork after election officials in Michigan certified Biden\u2019s win there, and a conservative Republican judge in Pennsylvania shot down a Trump campaign lawsuit, The Associated Press reported. Murphy\u2019s letter said: [Because] of recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results, I have determined that you may access the post-election resources and services described in Section 3 of the Act upon request. The actual winner of the presidential election will be determined by the electoral process detailed in the Constitution.        So, in short, a member of the Trump administration, Murphy, filed paperwork to change Biden\u2019s official title in government systems to \u201capparent president-elect\u201d and, as a result, granted him new privileges that only someone with that job title in federal government gets. But it was a wrong interpretation of that procedural step to claim Trump had therefore conceded the 2020 presidential race. Let us note here: No constitutional mandate or federal law requires losing presidential candidates to acknowledge defeat in order for the election\u2019s processes to continue. Rather, concession speeches have been an informal tradition that often symbolized a losing candidate\u2019s willingness to help with a peaceful transition between presidencies.  The Associated Press reported: In recent days, senior Trump aides including chief of staff Mark Meadows and White House counsel Pat Cipollone had also encouraged him to allow the transition to begin, telling the president he didn\u2019t need to concede but could no longer justify withholding support to the Biden transition. [\u2026] Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the GSA action \u201cis probably the closest thing to a concession that President Trump could issue.\u2033 Even after Murphy\u2019s letter, the Trump campaign sent supporters emails promoting false claims about the election outcome to solicit donations, including messages to sell \u201cCOUNT ALL LEGAL VOTES\u201d T-shirts.  Additionally, on Twitter the president said: \u201cRemember the GSA has been terrific, and Emily Murphy has done a great job, but the GSA does not determine who the next President of the United States will be.\u201d         The tweet accurately suggested that presidential elections are technically unfinished until the Electoral College casts its votes and Congress certifies that count, no matter what the administrator does or says. However, it was a misinterpretation of the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes, and state statutes to regard those post-Election Day procedures \u2014 steps that officially cement Americans\u2019 pick for president \u2014 as an opportunity to defy the will of the voters without providing compelling evidence of error or fraud. Hours after that tweet, Trump called reporters to a White House briefing room. He gave one-minute remarks about the economy and exited the room without taking questions from reporters. As he walked out, journalists shouted questions about his lack of a concession, and the president did not acknowledge them, White House footage of the event showed. In short, while a government agency under Trump\u2019s administration for the first time officially acknowledged Biden the \u201capparent president-elect\u201d in a letter that grants him access to federal assets before his swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20, 2021, it is false to claim that Trump had conceded defeat to the president-elect.

    "claim": "A video shows the illegal collection of ballots for the 2020 election in California. ",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. A video showing election workers collecting ballots from a drop box was widely circulated on social media in the days following Election Day, Nov. 3, 2020, along with claims that it showed some sort of nefarious activity. One posting, for instance, was accompanied by the text: \u201cI thought there was no evidence mail in voting was prone to fraud?\u201d Another posting was shared with the claim that \u201cNicaragua and Senegal could do a better job at compromising the people\u2019s trust in the electoral system. RIP USA.\u201d On Nov. 11, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump shared the video to social media, writing: \u201cYou are looking at BALLOTS! Is this what our Country has come to?\u201d  This video does show election workers collecting ballots. However, this video was not taken on Nov. 11, and any insinuations that this video documents illegal or fraudulent activity are false.          This video was taken on Nov. 4, 2020, in Los Angeles, California, and shows election workers collecting ballots that were delivered to a drop box the night before. This is in line with California law. California, like many states, accepts mail-in ballots as long as they are postmarked on or before Election Day. California residents can deliver mail-in ballots via a drop box, as shown in the above-displayed video, up until \u201cthe close of polls at 8:00 p.m. on Election Day.\u201d Mike Sanchez, a spokesman for the L.A. County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk (RR/CC) told Reuters: \u201c[These] are valid ballots and will be processed and counted in our Official Election Canvass \u2026 All vote by mail ballot drop boxes were closed and locked at 8 PM on Election Day. Ballots from all boxes throughout the County were picked up the following day.\u201d While this viral video does not show the illegal collection of ballots (this video actually shows election workers picking up mail-in ballots that were delivered to a drop box the night prior), it does show ballots being collected after news outlets called the race in California. But, again, that is not indicative of fraud or illegal activity.  The Associated Press explains that it called the race in California as soon as polls closed because data from early voting statistics confirmed that the longstanding blue state would remain blue in 2020. The Associated Press wrote: The AP declared Democrat Joe Biden the winner of California as soon as polls closed in the state, even though election officials there had yet to release any results from Tuesday\u2019s presidential contest. The news agency did so after results from AP VoteCast and an analysis of early voting statistics confirmed expectations that the state\u2019s longstanding political trend in favor of Democratic presidential candidates will hold. VoteCast, the AP\u2019s wide-ranging survey of the American electorate, captures voters\u2019 choices and why they made them. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in California by 30 percentage points in 2016, and a Republican presidential candidate hasn\u2019t carried the state since George H.W. Bush in 1988. California is the most populous state in the U.S. and its 55 electoral votes make it the biggest Election Day prize. The Associated Press\u2019 projection certainly proved accurate. As of this writing, a week after Election Day, Joe Biden is leading in the state with 10,268,890 votes (or 64.3%), compared to Trump\u2019s 5,368,263 votes (33.6%). "

    "claim": "U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held up a coronavirus funding package so that Democrats could run negative ads about Republicans that made the latter look bad.",
    "content": " As cases of COVID-19 caused by a new coronavirus grew in the U.S. amid a global outbreak, U.S. lawmakers attacked each other over the government\u2019s response to the illness in early 2020. One such example: A Republican Twitter account accused U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of delaying a vote on a coronavirus-funding package on the House floor so that a Democratic political organization could run ads against Republican lawmakers to make the latter look bad.  We reached out to McCarthy\u2019s office asking what he meant by his claim that Pelosi delayed the vote on a $8.3 billion funding package to fight the coronavirus but did not hear back. As of March 3, 2020, when McCarthy made the remark, both Republicans and Democrats were continuing to negotiate the funding package that the House passed the next day. Pelosi\u2019s chief of staff, Drew Hammill, took to Twitter to respond to McCarthy, pointing out as much. \u201cThe bipartisan negotiations on the coronavirus funding supplemental are still underway. Your staff have been participating in those talks,\u201d Hammill wrote, calling McCarthy\u2019s comment \u201ca disgusting and false accusation.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s office also didn\u2019t respond to our emailed questions. The Capitol Hill-oriented news publication Roll Call reported the same day McCarthy made his remark that, \u201cLawmakers late Tuesday were polishing up a roughly $8 billion emergency aid package to respond to the COVID-19 illness, with signs pointing to talks going on into the wee hours.\u201d Roll Call further reported on the content of what legislators were debating: By most accounts, there was bipartisan agreement on the broad contours of the measure. But a Democrat briefed on the negotiations said Tuesday night that outstanding issues included price limitations for drug treatments and eventually vaccines; reimbursements to hospitals for uncompensated care; and a Medicare waiver to allow payments to certain health care providers for telehealth services, such as in-home video visits.         Trump soon signed the funding bill into law, on March 6. In terms of \u201ccampaign ads,\u201d McCarthy appeared to be referencing a March 2, 2020, announcement made by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the organization that recruits and raises money for Democratic candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives. The DCCC, which is currently chaired by U.S. Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Illinois, announced that it would run ads targeting seven \u201cvulnerable\u201d Republicans that would urge citizens to \u201cstand up to President Trump to demand a vaccine that is affordable for all Americans, not just the wealthy.\u201d The ads are in response to statements by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar that he couldn\u2019t guarantee an eventual coronavirus vaccine would be affordable to the public. Because both Republicans and Democrats were still negotiating the coronavirus-response funding package at the time McCarthy made his comment \u2014 and there was no final bill yet for Pelosi to bring to the House floor \u2014 and because Pelosi doesn\u2019t chair the DCCC or run its ad campaigns, we rate the claim that Pelosi stalled virus funding for political purposes as \u201cFalse.\u201d "

    "claim": "New Jersey passed a bill to keep President Trump off 2020 ballots if he doesn\u2019t release his tax returns.",
    "content": " One of the many controversial aspects of Donald Trump\u2019s political career has been his continued refusal to release his tax returns to the public, despite his having promised to do so multiple times (starting before he even announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential campaign). Candidates for the office of President of the United States are required to file public financial disclosure reports with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).  Although the FEC disclosure regulations don\u2019t specifically require candidates to make their tax returns public, every major party presidential nominee since 1976 has done so voluntarily (with the exception of Gerald Ford, who didn\u2019t release his actual tax returns in 1976 but did at least provide summary data about his federal taxes for the previous nine years). Some major party presidential nominees have released tax returns from multiple years, while others have released only a few years\u2019 worth, but Trump remains the only one in the last several decades who has not disclosed any tax returns at all.  (A portion of Trump\u2019s 2005 federal tax return was leaked to the public.)  Now, some individual states are making efforts to require presidential candidates to release their tax returns.  On 21 February 2019, for example, the New Jersey state Senate passed a bill (S119) that would require candidates for President or Vice-President to provide the Division of Elections with copies of their federal income tax returns for the five most recent taxable years, and agree to disclose those returns to the public, as a condition of having their names listed on ballots.           And, in order to preclude candidates from skirting that regulation through succeeding at write-in campaigns, that same bill would prohibit New Jersey electors from casting Electoral College ballots for any candidates for President or Vice-President who have not provided copies of their tax returns. Not surprisingly, reaction to the bill was divided along partisan lines:  State Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, D-Bergen, said there are two reasons releasing tax returns should be mandatory for those seeking the White House. One, she said, is that voters deserve to know every candidate \u201cwithout compromise.\u201d \u201cThey must know, unequivocally, that the person they vote for is invulnerable to blackmail, coercion or intimidation of any kind due to financial liabilities,\u201d Weinberg said. Two, she said, is that voters have the right to know that \u201cno action taken by an administration is motivated by personal financial gain, as opposed to the good of the republic.\u201d Still, state Sen. Joseph Pennachio, R-Morris, said Democrats are showing hypocrisy because New Jersey\u2019s governor and state lawmakers are not required to release their returns. Pennachio suggested an amendment to the bill requiring them to be included, but it was shot down. \u201cClearly, their bill is nothing more than a thinly veiled political stunt to keep President Trump off the ballot,\u201d Pennachio said. \u201cIt shows that they are unwilling to hold themselves to the same standard\u201d  The New Jersey bill still needs to be passed by the state Assembly and signed by the governor before becoming law, and even then it would be subject to legal challenges.  Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie vetoed a similar bill in 2017, declaring it to be \u201cclearly unconstitutional\u201d and a \u201ctransparent political stunt masquerading as a bill.\u201d Likewise, the California state legislature passed a similar tax disclosure measure in 2017, but it was vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown on the grounds that \u201cit may not be constitutional\u201d and would set a \u201c\u2018slippery slope\u2019 precedent.\u201d In 2018, the state Senates of  Maryland and Rhode Island passed similar measures, but in both cases those bills failed to clear committee in the House. In 2019, the Judiciary Committees of the Hawaii state Senate and House of Representatives have both cleared bills requiring executive branch candidates to disclose their federal income tax returns, but neither body has put it to a floor vote yet. Even if the New Jersey bill were enacted, it is unlikely to sway the 2020 presidential election by denying President Trump a spot on the ballot, given that the state provides only 14 electoral votes and  voted overwhelmingly Democratic in the 2016 election.  But that handful of electoral votes could be the difference in a race as close as the one in 2000 was, and of course the effect would be magnified if other states enacted similar legislation prior to the election.

    "claim": "A supercomputer called \"Hammer\" and a software program called \"Scorecard\" are being used to alter vote counts in the U.S. presidential election of 2020. ",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. In the days after news outlets called the 2020 U.S. presidential election and projected that Joe Biden would be the 46th president of the United States, the internet was flooded with various unfounded claims about voter fraud. One popular rumor concerned something called \u201cHammer and Scorecard.\u201d While this rumor was wide ranging, it basically held that a \u201cdeep state\u201d supercomputer named \u201cHammer\u201d and a computer program called \u201cScorecard\u201d were being used to alter vote counts.  We\u2019ll take a closer look at this rumor in the article below. But before we do, we should note that Christopher Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \u2014 a position he was nominated to in 2018 by U.S. President Donald Trump \u2014 has called the \u201cHammer and Scorecard\u201d rumors \u201cnonsense\u201d:  To be crystal clear on \u2b07\ufe0f, I\u2019m specifically referring to the Hammer  and Scorecard nonsense. It\u2019s just that \u2013 nonsense. This is not a real thing, don\u2019t fall for it and think 2x before you share. #Protect2020 https://t.co/f2FpSbRXKy \u2014 Chris Krebs #Protect2020 (@CISAKrebs) November 7, 2020          \u2018Hammer and Scorecard\u2019 Origins Rumors about the existence of a CIA supercomputer called HAMR (or commonly, \u201cHammer\u201d) can be traced to a man named Dennis Montgomery. According to the website American Report, Montgomery, whom the website describes as a \u201cCIA contractor-turned-whistleblower,\u201d designed and built this supercomputer.  An article published on American Report in October 2020 claimed that U.S. President Barack Obama commandeered this supercomputer shortly after taking office in 2009, used the \u201cScorecard\u201d program to steal the election in 2012, and that this program was being deployed again to steal the election for Biden in 2020. There are many reasons to take these claims with a hefty dose of salt. For example, the article does not explain, among one of its many plot holes, why this program was not used in 2016 to steal the election for Hillary Clinton, or why President Donald Trump, who has held office for the last four years, did not do more to secure our elections from Hammer and Scorecard in 2020.  The fact-checking website Lead Stories also notes that some of the specifics in the American Report article don\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. For example, American Report claims that Scorecard works by tampering with \u201ctransfer points\u201d between state computers and third-party election data vaults. The article claims that \u201cVR Systems Inc\u201d is one of these transfer points, but VR Systems\u2019 COO told Lead Stories that \u201cVR Systems does not do voter tabulation and is not connected to county or state voter tabulation systems.\u201d But perhaps the biggest red flag is this story\u2019s source, Montgomery.  The Daily Beast wrote: What Trump allies tend to leave out, however, is that Montgomery has a long history of making outlandish claims that fail to come true. As an intelligence contractor at the height of the War on Terror, Montgomery was behind what\u2019s been called \u201cone of the most elaborate and dangerous hoaxes in American history,\u201d churning out allegedly fictitious data that once prompted the Bush administration to consider shooting down airplanes. And now, Trump allies want voters to believe Montgomery\u2019s claims about the election. In 2006, Montgomery claimed that he had emails showing that Nevada Gov. Jim Gibbons was guilty of bribery. According to USA Today, the Justice Department cleared Gibbons of wrongdoing after a computer expert cast doubt on the authenticity of the emails that had been provided by Montgomery.  Gibbons, who was elected governor in 2006 after five terms in Congress, had steadfastly denied any wrongdoing despite claims by Dennis Montgomery that eTreppid Technologies LLC founder Warren Trepp lavished Gibbons with money and a Caribbean cruise in exchange for help winning contracts for his company. Montgomery\u2019s credibility was put in doubt after a computer expert questioned the authenticity of e-mails Montgomery claimed proved Gibbons was accepting gifts.        Montgomery was also accused of deceptive practices in 2014 when he claimed to have evidence of a conspiracy against Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. U.S. District Court Judge G. Murray Snow found that Montgomery\u2019s evidence amounted to \u201cjunk,\u201d and Arpaio agreed. The New York Times wrote: When Judge Snow suggested that the materials provided by Mr. Montgomery were \u201cjunk,\u201d Deputy Sheridan and Sheriff Arpaio agreed. \u2026 [Montgomery\u2019s] reputation, easily uncovered with a cursory search, includes ample allegations of deception. Federal officials came to believe that he had sold antiterrorism technology that proved to be a hoax. He has denied wrongdoing in a lawsuit. In 2007, he falsely accused the governor of Nevada at the time, Jim Gibbons, of having received kickbacks from Mr. Montgomery\u2019s former employer to help it secure secret federal defense contracts. Two years later, Mr. Montgomery was arrested on charges that he had written $1 million in bad checks at a Las Vegas casino. A court hearing is scheduled for Aug. 12. He filed for personal bankruptcy that year, over mounting gambling debts. \u201cThis guy hired a person previously found to be a con man,\u201d said Dan Pochoda, senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, which represents the plaintiffs in the case against Sheriff Arpaio. Here\u2019s a PBS report about some of Montgomery\u2019s fraudulent claims:      Despite Montgomery\u2019s history of deception, his claims about Hammer and Scorecard transitioned from the fringes to the mainstream when Fox News\u2019 Lou Dobbs interviewed Sidney Powell, the attorney for former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, on Fox Business.  Powell said: \u201cI think there are any number of things they need to investigate, including the likelihood that 3 percent of the vote total was changed in the pre-election voting ballots that were collected digitally by using the Hammer program and the software program called Scorecard. That would have amounted to a massive change in the vote.\u201d        Hammer and Scorecard in Action? The Director of CISA has dismissed the claims about Hammer and Scorecard altering vote counts, and these rumors originate with a man who has a long history of making deceptive claims. Still, social media users quickly found \u201cevidence\u201d that Hammer and Scorecard was real, and that it was truly being used to steal the 2020 election. In November 2020, a video started to circulate on social media that supposedly showed \u201cSCORECARD working in real time.\u201d  The Conservative Daily Post wrote: In this video, it\u2019s easy to see SCORECARD working in real time.      Hammer and ScoreCard switched 19,958 votes live on TV from Trump to Biden in the Pennsylvania Presidential Race! At the 00:04 mark, the video shows Trump 1,690,589 and Biden 1,252,537 \u2026 then the video cycles through the other \u2018crucial\u2019 states of Wisconsin, Arizona and Michigan. It returns to Pennsylvania at the 00:40 mark, and pay close attention here. Trump somehow LOST votes, giving his total at 1,670,631, which is a loss of 19,958 votes! At the same time, Biden picks up that EXACT amount, mysteriously gaining to 1,272,495. The above-displayed video does show a genuine clip from CNN. However, it is not evidence of wrongdoing. In fact, what this video shows isn\u2019t even very unusual. CNN, like most news networks, uses data from the National Election Pool to provide real-time election results during their coverage.  NBC News wrote: The NEP is a consortium of major news networks \u2014 ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC \u2014 that pools together resources to gather vote and exit poll data. The NEP works with the consumer research firm Edison Research to collect timely and comprehensive election data on Election Day and in the following days, weeks and months until results are certified by all states. The NEP licenses data to several news outlets, including Reuters and The New York Times, among others. The above-displayed video shows a momentary error in these real-time results. A source from CNN told us that this video showed a brief moment when the results were incorrectly transposed from the NEP and that this human error was caught, flagged, and quickly fixed (as shown in the video). This video is not evidence of a supercomputer hacking into the U.S. election system and altering vote counts. It\u2019s a video showing a momentary error that was quickly fixed thanks to the numerous safeguards in place to protect the integrity of elections.  CISA Director Kreb\u2019s message about the Hammer and Scorecard rumors bears repeating: \u201cRobust safeguards including canvassing and auditing procedures help ensure the accuracy of official election results,\u201d and that it is not true that a \u201cbad actor could change election results without detection.\u201d  CISA writes: Reality: Robust safeguards including canvassing and auditing procedures help ensure the accuracy of official election results. Rumor: A bad actor could change election results without detection. Get the Facts: The systems and processes used by election officials to tabulate votes and certify official results are protected by various safeguards that help ensure the accuracy of election results. These safeguards include measures that help ensure tabulation systems function as intended, protect against malicious software, and enable the identification and correction of any irregularities. Every state has voting system safeguards to ensure each ballot cast in the election can be correctly counted. State procedures often include testing and certification of voting systems, required auditable logs, and software checks, such as logic and accuracy tests, to ensure that ballots are properly counted before election results are made official. With these security measures, election officials can check to determine that devices are running the certified software and functioning properly. Every state also has laws and processes to verify vote tallies before results are officially certified. State processes include robust chain-of-custody procedures, auditable logs, and canvass processes. The vast majority of votes cast in this election will be cast on paper ballots or using machines that produce a paper audit trail, which allow for tabulation audits to be conducted from the paper record in the event any issues emerge with the voting system software, audit logs, or tabulation. These canvass and certification procedures are also generally conducted in the public eye, as political party representatives and other observers are typically allowed to be present, to add an additional layer of verification.

    "claim": "Democrats in a committee of the New York Assembly voted to block a bill extending the state's tuition aid program covering Gold Star families to include children of service members killed or disabled while not in combat.",
    "content": " In April 2019, local and national news outlets reported that Democrats in the New York State Assembly had voted to block legislation that would have expanded a state program offering tuition assistance to members of Gold Star families (spouses and dependents of service members killed or disabled in the line of duty). In most cases, the coverage also noted that a week earlier, the same committee had announced the appropriation of $27 million in tuition aid for Dreamers (the children of undocumented immigrants). That information was widely disseminated in online outrage pieces bearing headlines such as \u201cNY Dems block bill expanding college tuition for Gold Star families after approving $27M in tuition.\u201d Republican legislators reacted to the sequence of events by questioning the Democrats\u2019 priorities, as reported by Syracuse.com: New York lawmakers refused to advance a bill that would have provided free college tuition to the families of all military personnel from the state who were killed in the line of duty. The Assembly\u2019s Higher Education Committee voted 15 to 11 to hold the bipartisan bill, effectively ending its chances of making it to a floor vote this session. The move comes a week after lawmakers passed a $175 billion state budget that included $27 million to provide college tuition aid for undocumented immigrants. Some Central New York lawmakers said it was outrageous to block a bill that would likely cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars to help children of military members who died for their county.         Calling the committee\u2019s actions \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d Republican Assemblyman Gary Finch said: \u201cSoldiers who lay down their lives and make the ultimate sacrifice represent the best of us. The children they love so dearly deserve access to the opportunity and promise that is the hallmark of this country. I can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s in your heart when you vote \u2018no\u2019 on a bill like this.\u201d New York State Assembly Bill A2991 (also known as the \u201cHawley bill\u201d) proposed expanding the state\u2019s Military Enhanced Recognition Incentive and Tribute (MERIT) scholarship program \u2014 which already provides tuition and other assistance to family members of military personnel killed or disabled while engaged in (or training for) hostilities \u2014 to include family members of those killed or disabled in non-combat situations. A Republican co-sponsor of the bill said fewer than 500 New York college students would be eligible for the assistance under the provisions of the bill. The Democrats who voted to shelve the bill said they weren\u2019t opposed to the idea of expanding aid to more families of fallen service members, but rather held the legislation back due to budget considerations. Democratic Assemblyman John T. McDonald III explained as follows in an opinion piece published in the Times Union: The committee moved to hold the bill due to the fact that it is an issue that is more appropriately addressed in the context of state budget discussions. The effect of the Hawley bill would significantly change the current program and would increase eligibility to the point where additional funding would be necessary. Therefore, there are very likely significant costs attached to the proposal that were not appropriated for in the 2019-20 enacted state budget. The members who voted to hold the bill in committee were not voting against the bill, the issue, or the concept. Instead I believe further discussion is needed on how we fund the bill, rather than advancing a bill that does not have funding attached to it, which would be a disservice to those who may not be as familiar with the state budget process. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, expressed his full support for the legislation, as did some other Democratic lawmakers in the state capital. \u201cWe have a moral obligation, a social obligation to help those families who lost their provider, their loved one, in service to this nation,\u201d Cuomo said in a television interview. \u201cSo, I would support providing free college tuition to SUNY schools for the children of people who were lost in service to the military.\u201d Cuomo said he believed the bill could still pass during the current legislative session. \u201cIt requires a legal change, but I would support that legal change, and we have many more weeks of legislative action,\u201d he said. A compromise bill co-sponsored by Republicans and Democrats in mid-April would have expanded the MERIT program, but wasn\u2019t set to go into effect until April 2020, at the beginning of the state\u2019s fiscal year. Cuomo said it wasn\u2019t soon enough and announced a plan on April 17 to shift funds from other programs to immediately grant tuition assistance to family members of all New York military members who were killed while performing any official duties.
