    "claim": "A photograph shows \"the darkest baby in the world.\"",
    "content": " In June 2015, a photograph purportedly showing the \u201cworld\u2019s darkest baby\u201d began circulating on the internet.  Social Trends PH, one of the first web sites to post the image, didn\u2019t provide any information about the photograph other than claiming that it was taken in South Africa:  An alleged darkest baby in the world that was recently born in South Africa is making buzz in social media. Many netizens however are asking if this photo is real or fake. By quick research, the photo has no origin or nobody claims it. There is also no report from the mainstream media about this news. Guinness World Records doesn\u2019t have this information also from their online database. Here is the photo.   The earliest online appearance of this picture we could uncover dated from on 10 June 2015, when it was posted by Twitter user @NaimHumphrey, in a tweet that was also void of information other than the oft repeated \u201cSouth Africa\u201d claim. So where did this photograph come from? Was the world\u2019s \u201cdarkest baby\u201d really born in South Africa?         While we were not able to uncover the specific origins of the photograph, we were able to determine that the figure shown in the image is not a baby at all, but a doll:  The doll was created by \u201cBreath of Heaven\u201d artist Lilah Pearsons:  I began sculpting in 2005 drawing my inspiration from my love of animals.  In 2006 I began selling my art online and have enjoyed a fulfilling career making dolls ever since.  Each and every doll that I make starts from a lump of polymer clay and forms into something that comes from where, I don\u2019t really know.  Every time I sit down to sculpt is a new experience and I get lost in what I am creating.  At times frustrating, and always a learning and growing experience. I love Monkeys!!!! They are some of the most enjoyable little faces to sculpt. All my primates are partial sculptures with soft bodies for lots of pose-ability options.  They are made with quality doe suede bodies filled with tiny pellets.  All their clothing is handmade by me.  Pearson\u2019s website and her eBay store show several examples of similar small dolls. "

    "claim": "A photograph shows Barack Obama dressed as Lucifer for an 'Illuminati ritual.'",
    "content": " In June 2018, disreputable junk news sister sites Neon Nettle and Your News Wire (now News Punch) reported that a photograph of former President Barack Obama dressed up in a Satan costume, complete with a mask and horns, had been \u201cleaked\u201d to the Internet:  Although these sites and others such as Pol Investigates \u2014 a blog that rehashes \u201cinvestigations\u201d from the /pol/ forum on 4chan \u2014 went to considerable lengths in an attempt to \u201cprove\u201d that the masked man seen in the photograph was Barack Obama, the notion was based on nothing more than a few small sections of someone else\u2019s facial features bearing a passing resemblance to those seen a picture of Barack Obama. Here\u2019s one example of how these forums \u201cconnected the dots\u201d in order to show that this image truly pictured Barack Obama:          Regardless of how many lines might have been scribbled across these graphics, however, the claim quickly fell apart under closer examination. Where did this photograph come from? Conspiracy theorists frequently use the word \u201cleaked,\u201d implying that they have somehow gained access to secret information that others were trying to prevent from being disclosed.  This image wasn\u2019t \u201cleaked,\u201d however; it was publicly posted to Instagram by user @everysilversea on 20 January 2017 (the date of President Trump\u2019s inauguration) along with the caption \u201cclass &amp; grace, you\u2019re my favourite.\u201d The image was later deleted, but an archived version can be seen here. Pol Investigates asserted that this Instagram user \u201cadmitted\u201d the masked person seen in the photograph was Barack Obama when asked about the deleted image:   The Instagram user\u2019s responding to the loaded question \u201cWhat\u2019s with your Obama pic? Why did you delete it?\u201d by writing \u201ctoo much hate and not enough support\u201d is what was touted as \u201cconfirmation\u201d that the picture of the masked man was truly a photograph of Barack Obama. As this Instagram user was called a \u201cwitch\u201d and accused of covering for a \u201cMuslim satanic piece of shit,\u201d it seems reasonable to assume that her reason for deleting the photograph was the harassment she received after posting it, as stated. Who is the man in the mask?        It is difficult to identify a person based on one low-res photograph, especially one in which most of the person\u2019s face is obscured by a mask. Yet many viewers readily responded to the power of suggestion and jumped to the conclusion that Obama was connected to some form of Satanic worship based on a single image:  The timing of the photograph in itself demolished the absurd argument presented by News Punch:  It seems unlikely that Obama would dress up as Satan for a fancy dress competition or on Halloween. The fact that the person standing next to Obama \u2026 is dressed normally suggests that this photo was not taken at a fancy dress party, but rather that Obama was participating in an Illuminati ritual and paying his respects to his Lord Lucifer.  Since the photograph in question was posted on the day of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration (i.e., the last day of Barack Obama\u2019s term of office), it had to have been taken while Obama was still President of the United States. The notion that a sitting president could be cavorting about in a Luciferian costume, participating in an \u201cIlluminati ritual,\u201d and posing for photographs openly posted to social media, all without any word of his activities reaching the press or the public until some fake news sites sleuthed it out long after the fact, is ridiculous in the extreme. The person in the mask \u2014 at least, the small portion of that person\u2019s face which is visible \u2014 bears a passing resemblance to the features of Barack Obama. But a much more logical conclusion about his identity can be reached than the far-fetched assumption that person was the President of the United States.  The head piece in this photograph, which was created by Miss G Designs and the pictured costume were both worn to a Burning Man Festival in 2015 by New York Real Estate agent Michel Madie. We\u2019ve found several other images of Madie in this headdress and costume via Ben Henretig, Scott London, and Facebook:         Indeed, photographs of Madie show him to bear a strong resemblance to the masked features visible in the alleged picture of Barack Obama:                       Or, as someone charted in the language of conspiracy buffs:  Artur Davis,  who represented Alabama's 7th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2003 to 2011 and was one of the national co-chairs for Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.  However, Davis bears only a passing resemblance to the person pictured here:  Supporters of this theory also noted that the man who isn't Artur Davis was wearing a jacket with the word \"Chicago\" written across it's front.&nbsp;  As far as we can tell the visible letters on the man's jacket are \u011b, c, and a. (or possibly c, c, and a). Those letters, in that order, will never spell Chicago; even if \"Chicago\" was printed all over his coat, it's unclear what that proves or what evidence it supports. The \"Chicago\" claim is just one example of the faulty logic and poor research used as evidence for this rumor. Although the man in this photograph does look similar to President Obama, no evidence has been provided to definitely determine that the former President was actually dressed up in this costume. --> "

    "claim": "Jeffrey Epstein once owned or displayed in his home a painting that depicted former President Bill Clinton wearing a blue dress. ",
    "content": " After the death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in jail in August 2019, reports emerged that claimed to detail an unusual choice of artwork in the disgraced financier\u2019s New York City apartment some years earlier.  On Aug. 14, the Daily Mail reported that Epstein \u201chad a bizarre portrait of Bill Clinton in a dress hanging in his Manhattan mansion,\u201d adding: \u201cThe picture depicting the former president apparently lounging on a chair in the Oval Office, wearing red heels and posing suggestively in a blue dress redolent of Monica Lewinsky was in a room off the stairway of the Upper East Side townhouse. The dress is also strikingly similar to one worn by Hillary Clinton at the 2009 Kennedy Center Honors.\u201d  The DM has a 2012 pic that allegedly shows the inside of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s NYC mansion. He had a painting on the wall \u201cwhich appeared to be Bill Clinton wearing a blue dress &amp; red heels\u2026 The blue dress seemed to be a pointed reference to Clinton\u2019s former intern Monica Lewinsky\u201d pic.twitter.com/VyAnk3Bnfn \u2014 John Doe (@JohnDoe78359022) August 14, 2019          The Mail included a photograph that an unnamed source claimed to have taken at Epstein\u2019s apartment in October 2012, and that purportedly showed a view of the painting hanging on a wall through an open doorway. Clinton was an acquaintance of Epstein\u2019s, and his representatives had sought to distance the former president from him, after Epstein was indicted on child-sex-trafficking charges in July. Epstein was awaiting trial in a New York jail when he reportedly took his own life on Aug. 10.  The New York Post appeared to corroborate the Mail\u2019s earlier reporting, citing unnamed \u201claw enforcement sources,\u201d one of whom purportedly told the newspaper:  \u201c[The painting] was hanging up there prominently \u2014 as soon as you walked in \u2014 in a room to the right. Everybody who saw it laughed and smirked.\u201d We received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of reports that Epstein had once owned the painting, or that it was at one time displayed in his home. So far, we have been unable to independently verify that the artwork was once in Epstein\u2019s apartment. The artist who painted it told Snopes she did not know the identity of the person who bought it in 2012 and was unaware of any connection to Epstein until a family member told her about news reports in August 2019.  \u2018Parsing Bill\u2019 This much we know: The painting shown in the photograph published by the Daily Mail is authentic. It is entitled \u201cParsing Bill\u201d and was painted in 2012 by the Australian-American artist Petrina Ryan-Kleid, while she was obtaining a master of fine arts degree from the New York Academy of Art. As of Aug. 15, prints of the painting were available to purchase from the prominent online art gallery Saatchi. A larger version of the work can be viewed here.  In April 2012, Ryan-Kleid was photographed standing next to the work at the Tribeca Ball, an annual art exhibit run by the New York Academy of Art, and a popular event for New York socialites. Ryan-Kleid told Snopes that\u2019s where an unidentified buyer purchased the original work. In an emailed statement, the artist wrote: \u201cIn 2012, as a grad student at the New York Academy of Art, I painted pictures of Presidents Clinton and Bush as part of my Master\u2019s thesis.  When the school put on a fundraiser at the Tribeca Ball that year, they sold my painting to one of the attendees. I had no idea who the buyer was at the time. As with most of my paintings, I had completely lost track of this piece when it was sold seven years ago. So it was a complete surprise to me to learn yesterday that it wound up in Epstein\u2019s home.\u201d Ryan-Kleid did not recall having sold the painting to Epstein, specifically, and said she first heard about any potential link to the financier from a family member who had read the August 2019 news reports mentioned above. As such, she was not able to offer corroboration for those reports, or for claims that Epstein had once had the painting in his home, or that the photograph published by the Daily Mail was in fact taken at Epstein\u2019s apartment. Until and unless further corroborating information becomes available, we are therefore issuing a rating of \u201cUnproven.\u201d "

    "content": " On 12 December 2016, a user submitted a version of the image reproduced in the Tweet above to Reddit, in an r/pics thread titled \u201cGroomsman hold up paralyzed groom for his wedding.\u201d By the following day, the image and its purported backstory were described as \u201ctrending,\u201d and Cosmopolitan covered them with using a clickbait title (\u201cThis Photo Got Retweeted Over 1.4k Times For The Sweetest Reason\u201d), in an article that began as follows: If there weren\u2019t already enough reasons why we love Twitter, here\u2019s another: Sometimes, on a normal non-spectacular Friday, whilst casually scrolling through your TL, you stumble across the cutest stories that make you appreciate humanity a little bit more. This time, a tweeter shared a photo of a groom being held up by his four groomsmen as he kissed his bride.\u201dHe\u2019s paralyzed, but his friends held him up to get married ?? Those are real friends ???,\u201d @EllaBandzzz tweeted, as she posted the moving photo \u2026 posted on 11th December, is so touching that it\u2019s been retweeted nearly 1.5 thousand times, and has over 1,000 Likes. Cosmopolitan eventually ceded that the picture\u2019s backstory was most likely not as described, but only following multiple emoji-laden paragraphs that created the opposite impression. At best, it seemed odd to leap to the conclusion that the groom was being \u201cheld up\u201d by several groomsmen in a pose that made no sense for its intended purpose; at worst, it seemed social media hucksters decided to use a random couple\u2019s wedding photographs to hawk a made-up story for pageviews. The Reddit thread responsible for the image\u2019s viral spread was full of impossible-to-ignore comments at the top, in which users disputed the claim because they recognized the pose in the photograph immediately: Comment from discussion Groomsman hold up paralyzed groom for his wedding.          Comment from discussion Groomsman hold up paralyzed groom for his wedding.    Comment from discussion Groomsman hold up paralyzed groom for his wedding.  Although blogs and viral picture sites were quite likely sourcing the image from Reddit, none of them appeared to note the large consensus that the photograph depicted a common \u201cfraternity pose.\u201d The web site Diply responsibly covered the claims, identifying Instagram user Rita Shaw and new husband Jared as the image\u2019s subjects: When Rita Shaw posted this lovely moment from her wedding on Instagram three weeks ago, she probably wasn\u2019t surprised with the number of likes it received. After all, it\u2019s a stunning photo that obviously captured an extremely meaningful moment for her and her husband. However, I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t expect someone to then post the image on reddit with the caption: \u201cGroomsman hold up paralyzed groom for his wedding.\u201d Take the beautiful wedding photo of Rita and Jared Shaw as a perfect example of just how quickly and easily a fake story can come to life. All it took was a misinformed reddit post to cause this couple\u2019s special photo to go viral, but not for a reason they would have ever expected \u2026 I set out to find the truth behind this inspiring image, and eventually, I found the original, which, as I said before, was posted on Instagram by the bride, Rita Shaw \u2026 Along with her image was the caption: \u201cHappy Founders day to the good Bruhz #RQQ.\u201d After looking up #RQQ, I found out that it represented Omega Psi Phi, an international fraternity that was founded in 1911 by Howard University students. Also included were several images of Jared Shaw, standing and dancing without the assistance of his groomsmen:    The viral image and its fabricated backstory were considered by many viewers to be harmless and inspiring, but the newly-married Shaws likely had no desire for memories of their special day to be marred by a viral lie. The false backstory was an example of the particularly unsavory practice of reducing disabled people to objects of motivational sentiment (\u201cinspiration porn\u201c), eliding the difficulties they face and reducing them to one-dimensional plot devices in syrupy yarns. We contacted Rita Shaw via Instagram for comment but have not yet received a response. (Her account has since been set to \u201cprivate.\u201d) "

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.   The weekend of April 17-19 saw a number of demonstrations take place in cities across the U.S. in protest of continued lockdown orders intended to limit the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. According to the BBC. Those taking to the streets say that the stringent measures restricting movement and businesses are unnecessarily hurting citizens. Protesters say the stay-at-home measures imposed by state governments to control the spread of Covid-19 are an overreaction. Some have also come bearing firearms as gun rights groups have been among the organisers, citing infringements on civil liberties. Some also say keeping these restrictions in place too long will cause long-term damage to local economies. For the most part the anti-lockdown protests were peaceful, although a few unseemly incidents of a non-violent nature did take place. For example, social media posts claimed that a few people in Columbus, Ohio, had taken advantage of the demonstration to display an anti-Semitic message:          Unfortunately, this image was all too real, as Cleveland.com reported: A photo from the stay-at-home protest at the Statehouse is gaining traction on Twitter for its anti-Semitic message. The photograph captured two men in a minivan. One held a sign with an illustration of a rodent with the Star of David on its side and the words \u201cThe Real Plague.\u201d The protest movement against coronavirus restrictions has been a mishmash of people. Some adhere to public health officials\u2019 guidance of distancing themselves at least 6 feet apart and wearing masks. They want to return to work. On the more extreme are others who call coronavirus a hoax. But the anti-Semitism might drown out all their messages. Ohio state Rep. Casey Weinstein, who had previously tweeted the above photograph along with the comments \u201cThere is a long, scary and disgusting history of blaming Jews for plagues and disease. NOT ON MY WATCH\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll call this out and stand right up to antisemitism wherever and whenever I see it!\u201d also tweeted a second photograph of the two men wielding the anti-Semitic sign:  Hey!

I\u2019m not going to let that pass. I\u2019m not. There are people out there exercising their rights. By no means am I saying they\u2019re all anti-Semitic, they\u2019re all racists, but there is an element there. I\u2019m glad to support everyone\u2019s First Amendment right to express their view, and I will gladly exercise mine to push back on anti-Semitism whenever and wherever I see it.\u201d "

    "claim": "A photograph shows eight rainbows over Lehigh, Pennsylvania.",
    "content": " In May 2016, a photograph began to make the online rounds, purportedly showing eight rainbows in the sky \u2014 all at the same time \u2014 over Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania:  Lehigh Valley, PA a friend\u2019s picture of eight rainbows!   Although this image was often shared as legitimate, it was based on a photograph that has been digitally manipulated. The image was originally a picture of a multiple rainbow uploaded to:Imgur in 2014:  While the triple rainbow photograph (a faint fourth rainbow can be spotted on the right of the picture) is most likely authentic, little information is available about when and where it was taken. In April 2015, a similar photograph circulated on the web. Paul Neiman, a research meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Earth System Research Observatory, explained that these \u201cquadruple rainbows\u201d do exist, but only under rare conditions. They come from two different light sources \u2014 the sun and a large reflective surface, such as a lake:   This is an outstanding example of a primary and secondary rainbow (relatively common) occurring together with their reflected-light counterparts (quite rare). Allow me to elaborate. A typical primary rainbow is caused by refraction and one internal reflection of sunlight within raindrops, resulting in a rainbow that is positioned 41 arc degrees from the anti-solar point (i.e., the point directly opposite the sun \u2013 for example, if the sun is 10 degrees above the horizon at your back, the anti-solar point is 10 degrees below the horizon directly in front of you). The refraction causes the separation of white sunlight into its component colors, with red on the outside of the rainbow and violet on the inside. The secondary rainbow, which is centered 51 arc degrees from the anti-solar point (i.e., the larger of the two bows during a typical display), involves two internal reflections of sunlight within the raindrops rather than one, resulting in a reversal of the color sequence (red on the inside and violet on the outside). We can usually only see the portion of these rainbows above the horizon, because there isn\u2019t a sufficient density of raindrops between the observer and the ground to see the rainbow below the horizon (exceptions include full-circle rainbows viewed from locales such as airplanes and mountain tops). So far, so good. For the much rarer reflected-light rainbows shown in this spectacular photo, a large glassy-smooth water surface is required behind the observer. This smooth water surface reflects the sun, such that a second solar light source is generated. This reflected sun, which is located the same the number of arc degrees below the horizon as the real sun is above the horizon, creates a second primary and secondary rainbow on the opposite side of the sky from the sun, but with the center of these reflected-light rainbows above the horizon. The geometry dictates that the regular and reflected-light rainbows will join at the horizon, as this photo shows. The rainbows in this case do, however, comply with the laws of physics, unlike the ones in the doctored, eight-rainbow photograph.  "

    "claim": "Video clip shows an elephant painting a picture of an elephant.",
    "content": " The video seen here is \u201ctrue\u201d in the basic sense that it captures the real phenomenon of elephants who perform the physical process of creating drawings by holding brushes in their trunks and applying them to cards mounted on easels. A BBC News article described an exhibition of such paintings at an Edinburgh gallery in 1996:  Pictures which were painted by elephants have gone on display at an Edinburgh gallery. Art graduate Victoria Khunapramot, 26, has brought the paintings from Thailand to the Dundas Gallery on Dundas Street. They include \u201cself-portraits\u201d by Paya, who is said to be the only elephant to have mastered his own likeness. Paya is one of six elephants whose keepers have taught them how to hold a paintbrush in their trunks. They drop the brush when they want a new colour. Mrs Khunapramot, from Newington, said: \u201cMany people cannot believe that an elephant is capable of producing any kind of artwork, never mind a self-portrait. \u201cBut they are very intelligent animals and create the entire paintings with great gusto and concentration within just five or 10 minutes \u2014 the only thing they cannot do on their own is pick up a paintbrush, so it gets handed to them. \u201cThey are trained by artists who fine-tune their skills, and they paint in front of an audience in their conservation village, leaving no one in any doubt that they are authentic elephant creations.\u201d Mrs Khunapramot, who set up the Thai Fine Art company after studying the history of art in St Andrews and business management at Edinburgh\u2019s Napier University, said it took about a month to train the animals to paint.  The web site of the Asian Elephant Art and Conservation Project explains the background behind elephants\u2019 being taught to paint, with the resulting artworks being sold and the monies so raised being used to fund elephant conservation projects.  The site includes a video gallery that features several clips of pachyderm artists in action similar to the one linked above, as well as galleries displaying the individual elephants\u2019 works.  (Based on the similarity of drawings, we\u2019d guess that the elephant shown in the example video is Hong, a nine-year-old female living at the Maetaman Elephant Camp in Thailand.) However, although these animals may be creating artworks in a purely physical sense, critics contend that the elephants participating in this activity are not actually \u201cpainting\u201d in any meaningful sense of the word: They aren\u2019t engaging in any form of creativity, much less abstractly making free-form portraits of whatever tickles their pachydermic fancies at the moment; rather, they\u2019re simply actors performing in tourist trap attractions in Thailand, where they do nothing more than outline and color specific drawings they\u2019ve been painstakingly trained to replicate \u2014 and they manage that much only while receiving a good deal of prompting and guidance throughout the process from their mahout (trainers). As zoologist Desmond Morris wrote after he and scientist Richard Dawkins traveled to Thailand in 2008 to investigate the \u201celephant painting\u201d phenomenon:  So are these endearing mammals truly artistic? The answer, as politicians are fond of saying, is yes and no. Let me describe exactly what happens. A painting session begins with three heavy easels being wheeled into position. On each easel a large piece of white card (30in x 20in) has been fixed underneath a strong wooden frame. Each elephant is positioned in front of her easel and is given a brush loaded with paint by her mahout. He pushes the brush gently into the end of her trunk. The man then stands to one side of his animal\u2019s neck and watches intently as the brush starts to make lines on the card. Then the empty brush is replaced by another loaded one, and the painting continues until the picture is complete. The elephant then turns towards its audience, bows deeply and is rewarded with bananas. The paintings are then removed from their frames and offered for sale. They are quickly snapped up by people who have been astonished by what they have just witnessed. To most of the members of the audience, what they have seen appears to be almost miraculous. Elephants must surely be almost human in intelligence if they can paint pictures of flowers and trees in this way. What the audience overlooks are the actions of the mahouts as their animals are at work. This oversight is understandable because it is difficult to drag your eyes away from the brushes that are making the lines and spots. However, if you do so, you will notice that, with each mark, the mahout tugs at his elephant\u2019s ear. He nudges it up and down to get the animal to make a vertical line, or pulls it sideways to get a horizontal one. To encourage spots and blobs he tugs the ear forward, towards the canvas. So, very sadly, the design the elephant is making is not hers but his. There is no elephantine invention, no creativity, just slavish copying. Investigating further, after the show is over, it emerges that each of the so-called artistic animals always produces exactly the same image, time after time, day after day, and week after week. Mook always paints a bunch of flowers, Christmas always does a tree, and Pimtong a climbing plant. Each elephant works to a set routine, guided by her master.  The following video clip reveals something of how much an elephant is actually guided by its mahout during the painting process: Other critics contend that not only is the elephant painting phenomenon a misleading show put on to garner money from tourists, but that the animals who participate in it have been abused; therefore, visitors to Thailand should shun the purchase of such works:  I was recently sent an email video which shows an elephant painting a picture of an elephant holding a flower over its head and was asked to comment on it. As you may or may not know, I returned home last night after my 7th trip to Chiang Mai, Thailand, where the video was shot. I can tell you with absolute certainty that elephant did not create that picture out of a need for a creative outlet. It was trained to follow the mahout\u2019s (trainer) command and was purely following orders out of fear of the abuse it suffered during the training process. If you look closely during the wide angle shots you will see other mahouts standing on their elephant\u2019s left side and they too are leading their elephant during the process. The close ups show an elephant\u2019s trunk moving a paint brush across a canvas and it appears to be creating a picture, except it is taking commands from its mahout who is out of the shot.  The training process is called the \u2018phajaan\u2019 or \u2018crush\u2019 and is centuries old and is used throughout Asia today. It involves taking a 3-year-old baby from its mother\u2019s side and roping it into a small bamboo cage in which it cannot move except to breathe. Of course the elephant fights for its freedom and is beaten, poked with sharp bamboo, starved, dehydrated, and sleep-deprived until it submits to its captors\u2019 demands. The process may take a week, depending on how long it takes to \u2018crush\u2019 the elephant\u2019s spirit. About 50% of the babies die from the process and the survivors are left with physical and emotional scars for the rest of their lives.  The demand for elephant paintings comes mostly from Japan, Europe, and the US, and the motivation from the Thai people is purely financial since a single painting can fetch several thousand dollars. I honestly hope that if people knew the true process for creating a picture, they would not offer any support at all for it. So PLEASE tell your friends, family, anyone who will listen: DO NOT SUPPORT ELEPHANT PAINTINGS IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM!  &lt;!\u2013 Another photo gallery that captures painting pachyderms in action in Thailand can be viewed here. \u2013&gt; "

    "content": " The nature of Donald Trump\u2019s hair has been the subject of speculation for decades. Is it a hairpiece? Did he undergo hair transplants? Is it merely an unusual styling.  Or, as an image of his mother Mary Anne MacLeod Trump suggests, is his coiffure a family trait? A photograph purportedly showing Donald Trump\u2019s mother is often met with skepticism (and occasionally mean-spirited jokes) in large part due to the pictured woman\u2019s strong resemblance not just to her son\u2019s facial features, but to her uniquely Trumpian hairstyle:  This image achieved online virality in June 2016, after a documentary entitled \u201cWho Is Donald Trump?\u201d that included a 1997 interview with Mary Trump aired on the Australian television channel Foxtel, and a screen grab made the social media rounds:    This photo of Donald Trump's mum looks like a character in a film about Trump's life where Trump plays all the roles pic.twitter.com/eUXbfFT0X5 \u2014 Amanda (@Pandamoanimum) July 26, 2016           Who wore it better: Donald Trump's mom or this dollop of whipped cream? pic.twitter.com/IJbJ0xl51C \u2014 Spencer Althouse (@SpencerAlthouse) July 26, 2016  As US Weekly reported at the time:  In the screen grab from a 1997 interview with Australian TV network Foxtel, Mary is seen with an extremely tall and swoopy combover in the exact same shade as the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s famous coif. She\u2019s wearing big gold earrings and a large pearl necklace, and the uncanny family resemblance is undeniable.  The New Daily similarly reported of the documentary:  Cue a clip of Mary Trump, sporting a startlingly similar hairstyle to that adopted by her son, offering this warning in an interview more than 30 years ago: \u201cI don\u2019t think the life of a politician would suit him. He\u2019s too used to doing things his way and doing them right.\u201d  Although we have yet been able to view the original interview, other photographs and videos of Mary Anne MacLeod Trump show her with a similar features and hairstyle:   "

    "claim": "Daily sea ice data from 1979 to the present show a record-breaking low amount of global sea ice coverage beginning around October 2016.",
    "content": " On 16 November 16 2016, University of California at Irvine Ph.D student Zack Labe tweeted an image of a graph, which purported to show a daily time series of the extent of Earth\u2019s global sea ice for every year since the data first became available in 1978\u20131979. The graph, which generated numerous shares and retweets, appears to show that for the period beginning around October, the area of global sea ice has never been as low for this time of year as it is now. This chart has since generated spirited online debate over its authenticity as well as the utility of its presentation. The graph in question was created by a user named Wipneus in the climate message board the \u201cArctic Sea Ice Forum.\u201d That user documented the source of the data and the methods used to analyze it here. The numbers come from a set provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Centers, which is generated daily from observations from two satellites, NASA\u2019s Nimbus-7 and and the Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. While the image itself was not created by an official governmental organization, the data \u2014 which are publicly available \u2014 are accurate. Experts at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center have also noted the same trends, as reported by CNN:  \u201cIt looks like, since the beginning of October, that for the first time we are seeing both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice running at record low levels,\u201d said Walt Meier, a research scientist with the Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, who has tracked sea ice data going back to 1979.          While the image that Labe tweeted was of a metric called global sea ice area, Winepus has also produced a similar graph using a different metric called sea ice extent. The trends for both are broadly the same, but sea ice extent yields higher estimates because it has a lower threshold for what constitutes an ice-covered grid point on a globe. The first thing to be aware of with this graph is that it is not the kind of analysis that climate researchers usually plot. As reported by Jeff Masters on the Weather Underground\u2019s WunderBlog, the NSIDC usually plots both hemispheres separately:  \u201cAt NSIDC, we generally frown on the practice of looking at the global sea ice extent,\u201d said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, \u201cthe reason being that ice in the two hemispheres tends to behave rather differently; while Arctic extent shows clear downward trends in all months, the pattern for the Antarctic has been much more complex.\u201d  The overall shape of the combined plot presented by Winepus shows the cumulative contribution of the sea ice in both the Antarctic (which typically reaches its highest extent in the Northern Hemisphere summer) and the Arctic (which typically reaches its highest extent in the Northern Hemisphere winter). The reason for the dramatic divergence this year is that the Arctic and Antarctic are both experiencing anomalously low conditions at the same time \u2014 a rare occurrence. Most experts agree that the cause of the low sea ice in each hemisphere is likely caused by different phenomena. This year has been especially warm in the Arctic, both in terms of air temperature and sea temperature, as reported by CNN, which is in line with a decades-long trend of reduced sea ice:  October and November are typically a time of rapid ice gain for the Arctic region, as daylight hours become shorter and shorter and eventually non-existent during what\u2019s referred to as the \u201cpolar night.\u201d Air temperatures plummet to below zero degrees Fahrenheit and parts of the Arctic Ocean not covered with ice quickly become covered. But this year, those air temperatures are staying much warmer, closer to the freezing mark of 32 degrees Fahrenheit. To make matters worse, the water temperatures in the Arctic Ocean are several degrees above average, which is an expected result of having less sea ice. With less ice in the summer, more of the sun\u2019s rays can heat the darker water, as opposed to being deflected back into space by the white ice cover. The result is a feedback loop, and one that scientists have warned about for some time.  The more unexpected finding is the loss of sea ice in Antarctica at this time. Unlike the Arctic, Antarctic sea ice has generally been increasing year to year over the past couple of decades, despite overall warming trends globally. The Antarctic, as a system, is nothing like the Arctic, due to the open ocean circulation around Antarctica, a lack of land masses, and other factors that make understanding its trends difficult to explain. This finding was discussed by Antarctic climate researchers in a September 2016 post on The Conversation:  To our south, Antarctica has also just broken a new climate record, with record low winter sea ice. After a peak of 18.5 million square kilometres in late August, sea ice began retreating about a month ahead of schedule and has been setting daily low records through most of September.  These authors suggest factors that may play a role in the reduced sea ice, including changing wind patterns and warmer sub-surface ocean water rising to the surface, but they ultimately conclude:  Antarctica\u2019s climate remains a puzzle, and we are currently trying to see the picture with most of the pieces still missing.  The final questions of the debate are how valid it is to present global sea ice trends for both hemispheres in the same graph, and if that method misrepresents the severity of the trend. In a post about the chart on The Verge, Kaitlyn Tiffany published this statement from the NSIDC:  The combined number, while easy to derive from our online posted data, is not useful as an analysis tool or indicator of climate trends. Looking at each region\u2019s ice extent trends and its processes separately provides more insight into how and why ice extent is changing. Sea ice in the Arctic is governed by somewhat different processes than the sea ice around Antarctica, and the very different geography of the two poles plays a large role.  "

    "content": " On Nov. 8, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump traveled to the Georgia World Congress Center in downtown Atlanta to take part in a \u201cBlack Voices for Trump\u201d rally, at which the president launched an outreach initiative dedicated to \u201crecruiting and activating Black Americans in support of President Trump,\u201d as reported by (among others) CBS News: President Trump launched his campaign initiative Black Voices for Trump in Georgia, as he tries to make the case that his support among African-Americans is strong, despite low approval ratings. In his address, the president claimed African-Americans are coming back to the Republican Party in \u201crecord numbers,\u201d although the president gave no basis for that claim. Only 8% of black voters picked Mr. Trump in 2016, and his support among black voters was just 10% in a recent Quinnipiac poll. Mr. Trump made the case that Democrats are only interested in African-Americans for their votes every four years, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t fight\u201d for the African-American community. Mr. Trump insisted he won\u2019t take those votes for granted. \u201cThey don\u2019t care. But we do,\u201d the president said.  Some photographs purportedly captured at that event that showed both blacks and non-blacks wearing shirts bearing the identifier \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d prompted readers to query us about the authenticity of those pictures, particularly one photograph featuring an older white couple:  \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d T-shirt wearers are filling up the GWCC ahead of @realDonaldTrump Blacks Voices for Trump initiative. @FOX5Atlanta pic.twitter.com/HP1vR7bXWf \u2014 Aungelique Proctor (@aungeliquefox5) November 8, 2019            The latter photograph, and others like it, were indeed authentic, as described in a New Yorker article about the event (which included a different picture of the same couple): Before noon on Friday, as he was leaving the Atlanta Regional Commission\u2019s \u201cState of the Region\u201d breakfast at the Georgia World Congress Center, in downtown Atlanta, Bem Joiner, a local entrepreneur, saw an elderly white couple \u201cwalking so jovial towards us,\u201d as he later put it to me, in a direct message. The grinning couple wore matching white T-shirts with black lettering that read \u201cblacks for trump.\u201d Joiner, who is black, said, \u201cmy homegirl took the pic\u201d of the couple, which Joiner later posted on Instagram, \u201ccause I was too in awe of the situation.\u201d In the caption, Joiner referred to the scene as being something out of \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201d In fact, the couple was in the building for the inaugural Black Voices for Trump rally, which was going to begin a few hours later, in a nearby room. Some viewers apparently found such pictures somewhat incongruous, but in general we readily accept that people often support causes that don\u2019t directly affect them: men take part in League of Women Voters functions; healthy people participate in campaigns to raise awareness of breast cancer; citizens hold rallies in support of immigrants, etc. In that same vein, non-blacks might well demonstrate support for a political party or candidate who they felt would undertake greater efforts to assist black citizens.
