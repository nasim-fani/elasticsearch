    "claim": "A rare black rose grows naturally in Turkey.",
    "content": " On 25 May 2016, the Facebook page Higher Perspective published the above video purportedly showing a rare black rose that grows naturally in Turkey. Higher Perspective was not the first entity to make this claim. This rumor has been circulating since at least 2013, when RocketNews24 published a story about a rare black rose:  Until now, we never really understood what all the fuss was about roses. Women seem to love them, and men seem to spend inordinate amounts of money to purchase them for their sweethearts. But now that we\u2019ve seen the pitch-black Turkish Halfeti Rose, we\u2019re starting to understand that roses can be not only dangerous, kind of smelly and enchanting all at the same time, they can also be the perfect centerpiece of the most hardcore heavy metal album or low fantasy book cover of all time. These roses, which appear perfectly black to the naked eye, are said to grow only in small quantities and only in the tiny village of Halfeti, Turkey. The unique soil conditions and pH levels of groundwater in the area \u2013 which seeps in from the Euphrates \u2013 create the deep crimson red color of the rose, which is, for all intents and purposes, solid black unless inspected very closely. The origin of the black rose story followed a daisy chain of misinformation. RocketNews24 cited the Japanese-language blog Karapaia, which in turn cited a 2007 story published by Todays Zaman, which was reportedly based off a local news article published in Anatolia. Somewhere during the process, the rumor that black roses occur naturally in Turkey was born.  Yet we found no evidence of black roses growing naturally in Turkey or any other part of the world. While very dark red roses (which can appear almost black) do grow in nature, the photographs featured in the Higher Perspective video, as well as the ones included in the Rocket News article, were either digitally manipulated or featured dyed roses: The only thing close to a black rose are the very dark red roses referred to as Black Magic Roses or Bacarra Roses.  There is no such thing as a real black rose that Mother Nature has produced.  However roses can be tinted black to give a black color appearance.         For instance, the first rose featured in the Higher Perspective video was digitally darkened:  It should also be noted that many of these photographs were not associated with the claim that they were grown in Turkey until they were included in the RocketNews24 article published in 2013. When Todays Zaman published their article about the alleged \u201cblack rose,\u201d they included a photograph of a dark red flower:  It is possible that there is a type of flower with extremely dark coloring that\u2019s native to Turkey, but if it does exist, it\u2019s not shown in these photographs.

    "claim": "The Statue of Liberty was erected as a tribute to the accomplishments of black soldiers in the Civil War, and a black woman served as the model for Lady Liberty.",
    "content": "  Please read this and pass this on.  This is really some valuable information. Our children and so on need to know this kind of stuff.  Good day, It is hard to believe that after my many years of schooling (secondary and post) the following facts about the Statue of Liberty was never taught. Hundreds of thousands if not millions of people including myself have visited the Statue of Liberty over the years but yet I\u2019m unable to find one person who knows the true history behind the Statue \u2013 amazing. Yes, amazing that so much important black history (such as this) is hidden from us (black and White). What makes this even worse is the fact that the current twist on history perpetuates and promotes white supremacy at the expense of black Pride. During my visit to France I saw the original Statue of Liberty. However there was a difference, the statue in France is black. \u201cYou learn something new everyday!\u201d  The Statue of Liberty was originally a black woman, but, as memory serves, it was because the model was black.   In a book called \u201cThe Journey of The Songhai People\u201d, according to Dr. Jim Haskins, a member of the National Education Advisory Committee of the Liberty-Ellis Island Committee, professor of English at the University of Florida, and prolific black author, points out that what stimulated the original idea for that 151 foot statue in the harbor.  He says that the idea for the creation of the statue initially was the part that black soldiers played in the ending of black African Bondage in the United States. It was created in the mind of the French historian Edouard de Laboulaye, chairman of the French Antislavery Society, who, together with sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, proposed to the French government that the people of France present to the people of the United States through the American Abolitionist Society, the gift of a Statue of Liberty in recognition of the fact that black soldiers won the Civil War in the United States. It was widely known then that it was black soldiers who played the pivotal role in winning the war, and this gift would be a tribute to their prowess. Suzanne Nakasian, director of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island Foundations\u2019 National Ethnic Campaign said that the black Americans\u2019 direct connection to Lady Liberty is unknown to the majority of Americans, black or WHITE. When the statue was presented to the US. Minister to France in 1884, it is said that he demonstrated that the dominant view of the broken shackles would be offensive to a US South, because since the statue was a reminder of blacks winning their freedom. It was a reminder to a beaten South of the ones who caused their defeat, their despised former captives. Documents of Proof: 1.  You may go and see the original model of the Statue of Liberty, with the broken chains at her feet and in her left hand.  Go to the Museum of the City of N.Y, Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street (212) 534-1672 or call the same number and dial ext. 208 and speak to Peter Simmons and he can send you some documentation. 2.  Check with the NY Times magazine, part II May 18, 1986. 3.  The dark original face of the Statue of Liberty can be seen in the NY Post June 17, 1986, also the Post stated the reason for the broken chains at her feet. 4.  Finally, you may check with the French Mission or the French Embassy at the U.N or in Washington, DC and ask for some original French material on the Statue of Liberty, including the Bartholdi original model. You can call in September [phone number deleted]. Please pass this information along!  Knowledge is Power!  This item about the origins of the Statue of Liberty is difficult to explicate because it makes so many (sometimes conflicting) claims, so we\u2019ll distill its essence to four primary claims and discuss those:   The model for the Statue of Liberty (i.e., the woman who posed for the sculptor, or whose portrait the sculptor used) was a black woman.  The Statue of Liberty was intended to depict a woman with features representative of the \u201cblack race.\u201d  The Statue of Liberty was created as a tribute to black Civil War soldiers.  The Statue of Liberty was intended to symbolize the end of slavery in the USA.  Of these claims, the first three are demonstrably untrue; the final one may have some small element of truth to it.         We\u2019ll begin by examining some of the specific pieces of evidence offered in the piece quoted above:  In a book called \u201cThe Journey of The Songhai People\u201d, according to Dr. Jim Haskins, a member of the National Education Advisory Committee of the Liberty-Ellis Island Committee, professor of English at the University of Florida, and prolific black author, points out that what stimulated the original idea for that 151 foot statue in the harbor.  He says that the idea for the creation of the statue initially was the part that black soldiers played in the ending of black African bondage in the United States. On his web page, Dr. Haskins explains that he wrote no book with the title The Journey of the Songhai People, nor did he ever state that the statue was presented by the people of France to the people of the United States to honor the role of black soldiers in the Civil War. It was widely known then that it was black soldiers who played the pivotal role in winning the war, and this gift would be a tribute to their prowess. It is undeniable that blacks did indeed fight in the Civil War, and that some of them were awarded high honors for their bravery in battle.  However, black soldiers were not allowed to take part in combat until the final stages of the war, and estimates place their numbers in the Union Army at about 130,000 out of 2,100,000 men total (about 12% of the total).  While this figure is hardly insignificant, claiming blacks played the \u201cpivotal role in winning the war\u201d is a bit of an exaggeration.  And however much blacks contributed to the war effort, even today, with our advantages of more than a hundred years\u2019 hindsight and access to tens of thousands of books and other sources that collectively chronicle the Civil War in almost minute-by-minute detail, the average American is little aware that blacks took active part in the conflict or is familiar with their specific contributions. (One scarcely glimpsed any black soldiers in film depictions of the Civil War until the story of the war\u2019s first all-black volunteer company was portrayed in 1989\u2019s Glory, for example.)   The level of knowledge about this subject was far less in the era immediately following the war, when communications systems were rudimentary (telephone, radio, and recorded sound did not yet exist), comprehensive accounts of the war had not been prepared (even the participants knew little of what took place outside of their direct experience), and when the still-widespread prejudice against blacks meant that their role in the war was minimized or ignored (the war may have ended slavery, but it by no means resulted in the white population\u2019s acceptance of blacks as their social equals \u2014 the U.S. Army itself remained segregated until after World War II).  The notion that over a century ago, in a country thousands of miles away, details of the Civil War unfamiliar to the people who actually fought it were \u201cwidely known\u201d is too much to accept without substantial supporting documentation. You may go and see the original model of the Statue of Liberty, with the broken chains at her feet and in her left hand.  Go to the Museum of the City of N.Y, Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street (212) 534-1672 or call the same number and dial ext. 208 and speak to Peter Simmons and he can send you some documentation. First of all, there was no one \u201coriginal model\u201d for the Statue of Liberty: sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi\u2019s design went through many evolutionary changes before he settled on its final form.  The removal of chains that appeared in Lady Liberty\u2019s hands in earlier models was done not because it \u201cwould be offensive to the U.S. South,\u201d but for aesthetic reasons.  As the same Dr. Haskins cited above wrote:  \u201cAt first, she held a broken chain in her other hand, to symbolize the broken chains of bondage; later, Bartholdi decided she should hold a tablet, inscribed with the date of the Declaration of Independence, and that a fragment of chain would be on the ground, as if she had already thrown it there.\u201d    Broken chains fit the statue\u2019s theme, whether the message of liberty gained is applied to America\u2019s independence from Britain, France\u2019s then recent struggle with Prussia, or the freeing of African Americans from slavery.  Pictures of the models for the Statue of Liberty held by The Museum of the City of New York are available for viewing via the web.  Check with the NY Times magazine, part II May 18, 1986. We did, and we found that, in anticipation of the upcoming July 4 centennial celebration of the Statue of Liberty (and the culmination of a four-year, 66-million-dollar effort to repair and restore the famous monument), The New York Times magazine on that date was chock full of articles about the statue.  None of them said anything even remotely supportive of the claims made here, however; in fact, they said quite the opposite.  As Richard Bernstein, The New York Times\u2018 Paris bureau chief noted in that issue, the statue was intended as a tribute to both the American achievement of and French hopes for a nation of republic and liberty; in a sense, it was meant as an abstract symbol of the idealized future of France just as much as the realized past of America.  Creating a tribute to those who fought the Civil War (or, even more specifically, to black Civil War soldiers) was far too concrete (and too distinctly American) a concept to have been a part of their plans. The dark original face of the Statue of Liberty can be seen in the NY Post June 17, 1986, also the Post stated the reason for the broken chains at her feet. Yes, the \u201coriginal\u201d face of the Statue of Liberty was dark, for the simple reason that the materials of which it was made were originally dark.  Eric Fettmann, the author of the New York Post article cited above, wrote:  As for the photo of the supposed \u201cAfrican\u201d face featured in The Post, the picture is not \u2014 as incorrectly captioned \u2014 an early model, but shows the actual face that now stands over New York Harbor. The photo, as shown in Marvin Trachtenberg\u2019s marvelous 1976 architectural history of the statue, shows Liberty\u2019s head during construction on what was then Bedloe\u2019s Island shortly before its dedication in October 1886.  It appears \u201cblack\u201d for a simple reason: the copper statue\u2019s original color was not the familiar green we see today \u2014 the patina that naturally occurs over the course of repeated exposure to the elements \u2014 but a much darker orange-red bronze. (Actually, as the oxidation process continued, the statue first turned pitch black before reaching its current green hue, as Bartholdi knew it would.)  The reason that Fettmann offers for the broken chains is that Bartholdi \u201cadapted the statue from a failed project to construct a giant lighthouse at the entrance to the Suez Canal in Egypt\u201d; Bartholdi\u2019s original design for the lighthouse included a female figure with the broken chains of slavery at her feet. Finally, you may check with the French Mission or the French Embassy at the U.N or in Washington, DC and ask for some original French material on the Statue of Liberty, including the Bartholdi original model. The Embassy of France located in Washington would prefer not to be contacted by those looking for this \u2018original French material on the Statue of Liberty\u2019 because they can\u2019t help them. According to its Press and Information Service, \u201cWe constantly get calls from people requesting for information [on this issue], and we do not have reliable information to give them.\u201d  The statue wasn\u2019t meant as a tribute to black Civil War soldiers, nor were the women who modeled for it black.  Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, then a young French artist, was commissioned in 1865 by Edouard de Laboulaye and a group of influential French citizens to work on a monument to liberty, intended as a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States of America. Most sources agree that Bartholdi used his mistress (later his wife) and mother as Lady Liberty\u2019s models, with his mother serving as the inspiration for the face and his wife for the torso. Neither of these women was black.  As for the purpose of the statue, an 1879 design patent granted to Bartholdi contained his description of the work as \u201ca commemorative monument of the independence of the United States.\u201d There was no mention of black soldiers or the Civil War. Rather, the description specified \u201cthe independence of the United States,\u201d an event which predated the Civil War \u2014 and the abolition of slavery \u2014 by a few generations. Dr. Haskins holds that the impetus behind the Statue\u2019s creation was the abolition of slavery in America. Possibly France did not feel America deserved a monument dedicated to freedom as long as a significant portion of its population was enslaved.  That is not to say the Statue was dedicated to the abolition of slavery (else Liberty\u2019s tablet would surely have been emblazoned with the date of emancipation, not the date of its formal break from Britain), but that this happy change of affairs inspired some of those behind the gift to support the project.        One of the \u201cDocuments of Proof\u201d listed in the article, the magazine section of The New York Times from 18 May 1986, states:  The creators of the Statue of Liberty knew precisely what the message was. This group of high-minded French intellectuals, neither red revolutionaries nor white-ribboned monarchists, saw an inspirational model for France in the free institutions of the United States; they planned and designed the statue for several reasons, but chiefly to convey a subtle but unmistakable signal of republicanism to their countrymen.  \u201cThe creators of the statue wanted to praise the United States for its liberty, while at the same time suggesting to the French people that conditions were not the same in France, where the system of government was a kind of Caesarism,\u201d says Pierre Provoyeur, curator of the Museums of France and general commissioner of the French exhibitions for the statue\u2019s centennial celebration.  As a gift to the people of the United States, the statue was a kind of subterfuge, a means of promoting from outside France a political alternative for France itself. The plan worked, but the statue so evolved into an American landmark and a universal symbol that it requires an act of historical imagination for today\u2019s Frenchmen to recognize in her an image of their own past and their own political struggles.  If the statue had been intended as a tribute to prowess of black soldiers, the choice of a female form was a rather curious one.  All the combatants in the Civil War (and every other war of the era) were male, and women were not exactly the gender associated with the values of freedom and liberty in either the United States or France at that time. As Marina Warner notes in her book Monuments &amp; Maidens: The Allegory of the Female Form:  When we look at Liberty in female shape, we are not being invited to consider the freedom of women in classical times, or in the years when the statue was made and presented to the United States by the French Republic. In neither country did women enjoy equal rights, let alone special access to social and political liberties. Indeed, France was one of the last European nations to give women the vote.  In fact, the only thing said about the model on which the statue was based in The New York Times that day comes up in an excerpt from Warner\u2019s book:  Although Bartholdi\u2019s colossus has a stern, even implacable face, she remains unmistakably female, and indeed has been said to resemble Bartholdi\u2019s own mother, by all accounts a grim, overbearing woman who never overcame the outrage she felt when the family home in Colmar, Alsace, was occupied by the victorious Prussians in the war of 1870.  Another excerpt from Warner indicates that the whole \u201cthe model for the Statue of Liberty was a black woman\u201d may stem from its being confused with an earlier, abandoned project Bartholdi adapted to his new assignment:  Bartholdi\u2019s statue gives only one explicit reference to the history of the United States: the date \u2013 July 4, 1776 \u2013 in Roman numerals on the tablet she holds in her left hand. Perhaps this was because the Statue of Liberty did not originate with the plan for New York, but with a proposal Bartholdi made in the 1860\u2019s to the Khedive of Egypt, that he should build a huge lighthouse at the mouth of the Suez Canal. The maquettes of this project, \u201cEgypt Bringing Light to Asia,\u201d were directly inspired by the ancient Pharos of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. They still exist, and they reveal that had the Khedive agreed, the Statue of Liberty \u2013 in an Egyptian wig \u2013 would now be standing at the gates of the Middle East, not the New World.  Whatever the color of the person who served as the model for the Statue of Liberty may have been, the statue itself is colorless.  It does not represent a particular color of person any more than the Michelin Tire Man does, and the idea it symbolizes applies to people of all colors, whether or not its creators intended it that way.  Just as the attitudes of people who lived hundreds of years ago cannot require us look upon others as inferiors today, neither can they magically elevate the status of those who may still be the objects of discrimination.  That is a task for those of us who live here and now. "

    "claim": "A photograph shows a pair of \"negro skin shoes.\"",
    "content": " In March 2019, we encountered an image posted on Facebook that purportedly showed a pair of \u201cnegro skin shoes\u201d:  This image captures a pair of shoes reportedly made with human skin, but the alleged \u201cdonor\u201d in this case was not an African American man \u2014 rather, it was said to be George Parrott, a wild west outlaw known as \u201cBig Nose George\u201d:  Big Nose George was a cattle rustler, highwayman, and general bandit who robbed and killed his way across the American West in the 1870s and ultimately met his demise after a failed jailbreak in 1881. An article published by the Eaton Democrat on 31 March 1881 described his lynching:  At Rawlins, Wyoming, the notorious Big Nose George was taken from jail by a party of masked men and hanged. The rope was adjusted to a cross piece on a telegraph pole and Big Nose George was made to climb the ladder set against the pole for the purpose of placing the rope about his neck. He climbed high on the ladder saying, \u201cI will jump off, boys, and break my neck,\u201d and he did.          After Big Nose George\u2019s death, Dr. John Eugene Osborne performed a crude autopsy on the bandit in an apparent attempt to study the workings of a criminal brain. We\u2019re not sure if Osborne ever managed to find out what made Big Nose George tick, but the doctor did come away with a few bizarre mementos. According to Wyoming\u2019s Carbon County Museum, Big Nose George was tanned, and his skin was used for the uppers of a pair of shoes:  On March 22, 1881, while jailed in Rawlins, George made an attempt to escape. That night, vigilantes decided to ensure he wouldn\u2019t repeat the attempt successfully. They took him from the jail and strung him up from a telegraph pole. It took two attempts, but eventually the lynching succeeded and George strangled to death. No legal action was taken against the mob. Dr. John Osborne was summoned to confirm Parrot\u2019s death. Dr. Osborne made a plaster death mask, then took the skin from Parrot\u2019s chest and thighs. He had it tanned and made into a pair of shoes and other personal items. The bandit\u2019s remains were also used to craft other personal items: for example, the top of his skull was turned into an ashtray. We reached out to the Carbon County Museum, where the shoes in this viral photograph and some of these other macabre artifacts are still on display, for more information and will update this article if more information becomes available. We did turn up one report that described Big Nose George as being of dark complexion, but couldn\u2019t find any indications that he was of African descent:  Thus ended the earthly career of Geo. Parrott, who was undoubtedly one among the most desperate and dangerous criminals that ever trod the soil of Montana. He was about 5 feet 8 inches in height, complexion very dark, narrow, sloping forehead, jet black hair, and small beadlike eyes. His most prominent feature was his large Roman nose, from which peculiarity he gained the nickname of \u201cBig Nose George.\u201d  While the shoes seen in this particular picture may not have been made from the skin of a black person, such items did exist. For instance, a brief story published on 30 March 1882 in the Atchison (Kansas) Daily Globe mentioned a physician who wore a \u201cpair of shoes made from the hide of a negro.\u201d An article from the 29 October 1887 edition of the Oskaloosa Independent relayed a similar story: I remember that two or three years ago I incidentally referred to a prominent physician of this city wearing shoes made from the skin of negroes. He still adhered to that custom, insisting that the tanned hide of an African makes the most enduring and the most pliable leather known to man. Only last week I met him upon the street with a brand new pair of shoes. I looked at his foot wear, as I always do \u2014 his pedal coverings have an irresistible fascination for me \u2013 and said, with a smile: \u201cIs the down trodden African still beneath your feet?\u201d In the most matter of fact way, and without the shadow of a smile, he answered: \u201d I suppose you mean to inquire if I still wear shoes made of the skin of a negro. I certainly do, and I don\u2019t propose changing in that respect until I find a leather that is softer and will last longer and present a better appearance. I have no sentiment about this matter. Were I a Southerner \u2013 in the American sense of the word \u2013 I might be accused of being actuated by a race prejudice. But I am a foreigner by birth, although now an American citizen by naturalization. I fought in the rebellion that the blacks might be freed. I would use a white man\u2019s skin for the same purpose if it were sufficiently thick, and if any one has a desire to wear my epidermis upon his feet after I have drawn my last breath he has my ante mortem permission.\u201d The doctor\u2019s shoes always exhibit a peculiarly rich lustrousness in their blackness. He assures me that they never hurt his feet. The new pair he was using when I last saw him emitted no creaking sound and appeared as comfortable as though they had been worn a month. Their predecessors, he told me, had been in constant use for eight months. He obtains the skins from the bodies of negroes which have been dissected in one of our big medical colleges. The best leather is obtained from the thighs. The soles are formed by placing several layers of leather together. The skin is prepared by a tanner at Womseldorf, 16 miles from Reading. The shoes are fashioned by a French shoemaker of this city, who knows nothing of the true character of the leather, but who often wonders at its exquisite smoothness, and says that it excels the finest French calf-skin. Other articles from this time period also mention items made from human leather. Scientific American reported in 1907 that human skin had been used for a variety of products, including purses, slippers, belts, and even a horse saddle. The article stated that the materials used to make these human leather items were obtained from medical schools but did not mention the race of the deceased \u201cdonors.\u201d  "

    "claim": "A photograph of Franklin, the one black character on 'Peanuts,' sitting alone on Thanksgiving documents that the creator of 'Peanuts' was racist.",
    "content": " An image showing various Peanuts characters gathered around a Thanksgiving table tends to circulate online during the end-of-year holiday season, along with the accusation that it documents comic strip creator Charles M. Schulz was himself a racist for seating Franklin, the show\u2019s most visible black character, by himself on the opposite side of the table from all the other characters:  This image is a screenshot taken from the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving television special, which first aired on the CBS network on 20 November 1973: While the question of whether this particular aspect of that special should be considered \u201cracist\u201d is a subjective issue, we can shed some light on how Franklin became a Peanuts character, an action for which Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz had to fight against opposition from the comic industry. Franklin Armstrong made his first appearance in the Peanuts comic strip of 31 July 1968. At the time, the United States was struggling with desegregation, and while the country had taken several steps to integrate the population, issues about having black and white people attend the same schools, use the same bathrooms, or appear in the same comic strips were still matters of substantial controversy:          Schulz decided to add Franklin to the Peanuts gang after he began corresponding with Harriet Glickman, a retired schoolteacher from Los Angeles, who was concerned about race relations in America and wrote him in 1968, shortly after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. We spoke to Glickman, now 89 years old, by phone from her Los Angeles-area home, and she told us: My parents\u2026 were very concerned about others, and the values that they instilled in us about caring for and appreciating everyone of all colors and backgrounds \u2014 this is what we knew when we were growing up, that you cared about other people. And so, during the years, we were very aware of the issues of racism and civil rights in this country. And remember, when I was young, black people had to sit at the back of the bus, black people couldn\u2019t sit in the same seats in the restaurants that you could sit\u2026 the period before I wrote the letter was the major period of civil rights activities.  Every day I would see, or read, about black children trying to get into school and seeing crowds of white people standing around spitting at them or yelling at them \u2026 and the beatings and the dogs and the hosings and the courage of so many people in that time. So it wasn\u2019t as if, one day, I said, oh things are bad and Martin Luther King was shot and I should do something. It was the accumulation of all the years of seeing the discrimination, the segregation, the hatred and all\u2026. And I just thought, Maybe I\u2019ll do something. And I realized that Peanuts was the most beloved comic strip in the country. And I wrote not only to Schulz, but I wrote to a few other cartoonists, as well. Schulz was not the only one who responded to her entreaties, Glickman said. Allen Saunders, who along with Dale Connor created the long-running Mary Worth comic strip, responded with a \u201cvery thoughtful\u201d letter that he and his team were considering including a black character in their strip but ultimately demurred over fears that they would be dropped by their syndicator. Glickman\u2019s original letter to Schulz read as follows: Schulz replied that he had previously held off on introducing a black character, not because he was worried about meeting resistance to the concept, but because he wanted to avoid seeming to be patronizing. Glickman told us that she \u201cwrote back [to Sculz] and asked him if it was okay with him to show his letter to some African American friends.\u201d It was.  Schulz soon received a letter from one of Glickman\u2019s friends, Kenneth C. Kelly, dated 6 June 1968: Dear Mr. Schulz: With regards to your correspondence with Mrs. Glickman on the subject of including Negro kids in the fabric of Peanuts, I\u2019d like to express an opinion as a Negro father of two young boys. You mention a fear of being patronizing. Though I doubt that any Negro would view your efforts that way, I\u2019d like to suggest that an accusation of being patronizing would be a small price to pay for the positive results that would accrue! We have a situation in America in which racial enmity is constantly portrayed. The inclusion of a Negro supernumerary in some of the group scenes in Peanuts would do two important things. Firstly, it would ease my problem of having my kids seeing themselves pictured in the overall American scene. Secondly, it would suggest racial amity in a casual day-to-day sense. I deliberately suggest a supernumerary role for a Negro character. The inclusion of a Negro in your occasional group scenes would quietly and unobtrusively set the stage for a principal character at a later date, should the basis for such a principal develop. We have too long used Negro supernumeraries in such unhappy situations as a movie prison scene, while excluding Negro supernumeraries in quiet and normal scenes of people just living, loving, worrying, entering a hotel, the lobby of an office building, a downtown New York City street scene. There are insidious negative effects in these practices of the movie industry, TV industry, magazine publishing, and syndicated cartoons. Sincerely, KCK        Franklin made his debut less than two months later, but as a full-fledged (albeit sporadically appearing) friend of Charlie Brown\u2019s rather than as the suggested background character.  This was no small thing for a nationally syndicated comic strip, especially at the peak of the United States\u2019 race-related civil unrest of 1968 and 1969. However, Schulz\u2019s decision to add a black character to Peanuts did meet with resistance from some quarters. The comic book artist said in a 1988 interview that his editors continually wanted to change the comics in which Franklin appeared: I finally put Franklin in, and there was one strip where Charlie Brown and Franklin had been playing on the beach, and Franklin said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s been nice being with you, come on over to my house some time.\u201d Again, they didn\u2019t like that. Another editor protested once when Franklin was sitting in the same row of school desks with Peppermint Patty, and said, \u201cWe have enough trouble here in the South without you showing the kids together in school.\u201d But I never paid any attention to those things, and I remember telling Larry at the time about Franklin \u2014 he wanted me to change it, and we talked about it for a long while on the phone, and I finally sighed and said, \u201cWell, Larry, let\u2019s put it this way: Either you print it just the way I draw it or I quit. How\u2019s that?\u201d So that\u2019s the way that ended. While some have applauded Schulz for including a black character in his comic strip, others have criticized him for how the character was handled. Nat Gertler, the author of \u201cThe Peanuts Collection: Treasures from the World\u2019s Most Beloved Comic Strip,\u201d wrote that while Charles M. Schulz\u2019 inclusion of a black character was controversial, he was also overly cautious with how the character was used: Franklin\u2019s introduction was part of a five-day sequence featuring Sally tossing away Charlie Brown\u2019s beach ball and Franklin rescuing it. In some ways, this seems an aggressive bit of integration \u2014 many American public beaches, while no longer legally segregated, were still de facto segregated at the time. In other ways, the strips suggest what might be seen today as an excess of caution; of the twenty panels of the series, Franklin is in ten panels and Sally is in eight, but never is Franklin in the same panel as the white girl. Franklin would not reappear for another two and a half months, when he came for a visit to Charlie Brown\u2019s neighborhood. He was somewhat lighter skinned here, which seems to be less a matter of trying to make him acceptable to the readers and more a matter of cutting back on shading lines which were overpowering his facial features. Franklin\u2019s job in this series was to react to the oddness of the neighborhood kids, and that was a precursor to what would be his primary role in the strip as a whole. Perhaps due to excessive caution, Franklin was never granted any of the sort of usual quirks that define a Peanuts character, the very sort of mistake that Glickman was warning about when she called for one of the black kids to be \u201ca Lucy.\u201d Schulz may have had more to work with if he had listened to Bishop James P. Shannon, who had marched beside Martin Luther King in Selma; Shannon was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as wondering if the new Peanuts character would be \u201ca believable human being who has some evident personal failing,\u201d versus being \u201ca perfect little black man.\u201d But whatever failings (or problematic lack of failings) Franklin may have had, his appearance drew national media coverage, and made local comics page editors flinch. Charles M. Schulz did not discuss Franklin\u2019s seating position in A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, but he did respond to another accusation of racism regarding a strip published in November 1974:  Fifteen years ago, when the strip was drawn, I believe there was only one black in the national hockey league. Does pointing out this fact make the strip racist? Nat Gertler, author of the aforementioned book about Peanuts, another called The Snoopy Treasures: An Illustrated Celebration of the World Famous Beagle, and the AAUGH Blog, reached out to us after seeing this article, and wrote: The article does leave hanging out there the assumption that Charles Schulz himself planned the admittedly awkward shot being referenced. While Schulz definitely kept a hand in the animated work, by 1973 when the Thanksgiving special aired, the Peanuts characters were starring in not only a steady stream of TV specials, but also a series of animated feature films. Schulz certainly wasn\u2019t laying out every shot himself \u2014 he had a day job to take care of, writing and drawing the most popular comic strip going, as well as creating original books, handling licensing materials, and so on. A talented team of animation folks were doing their job on this. Besides, if you look, Franklin may not have had a table mate, but he did get more desserts than anyone! Franklin was not the first minority character in the strip (he\u2019s predated by semi-Latino Jose Peterson), nor the only African-American character (although he is by far the most visible.) But yes, Schulz stuck his neck out introducing Franklin at all, and I\u2019m glad this article is there to counter this rather frivolous accusation. \u2013Nat Gertler (PS: Peanuts nitpickers will tell you that the name \u201cFranklin Armstrong\u201d is non-canonical; the last name was introduced in an animated special, and in the eyes of Schulz as well as the hard-core fans, that doesn\u2019t count!) According to Cesar Gallegos, the archivist for the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa, California, the response to Franklin\u2019s introduction was, despite some editorial resistance, overwhelmingly positive from the reading audience. "

    "claim": "Black police officers are more likely to kill black people.",
    "content": " On 20 September 2016, researchers at the Crime Prevention Research Center released a study in which they addressed the following question: Do white police officers disproportionately target black people? The study noted that very limited data is available about the race of officers who are involved in custody deaths. While one data set in which the race is known seemed to show black police officers are more likely to kill black people across the board, the study\u2019s authors noted a number of factors could skew that result. Most important, in the vast majority of cases, the race of the officer who caused the death was not known. The most salacious aspect of the study was predictably pulled out and turned into inflammatory headlines, such as this one from the blog Western Journalism: \u201cThis Blows The Lid Off MASSIVE Black Lives Matter Lie \u2014 They Didn\u2019t See This Truth Train Coming.\u201d But as experts on the issue note, a consistent impediment to drawing conclusions about the issue of police shootings continues to be a data void. This problem was noted in the following study: We have data on a total of 2,699 fatal police killings for the years 2013 to 2015. This is 1,333 more killings by police than is provided by the FBI data on justifiable police homicides. When either the violent crime rate or the demographics of a city are accounted for, we find that white police officers are not significantly more likely to kill a black suspect. For the estimates where we know the race of the officer who killed the suspect, the ratio of the rate that blacks are killed by black versus white officers is large \u2014 ranging from 3 to 5 times larger. However, because the media may under report the officer\u2019s race when black officers are involved, other results that account for the fact that a disproportionate number of the unknown race officers may be more reliable. One of the authors, John Lott Jr., said that researchers collected data on the officers\u2019 race through media reports, by matching available names with police department photographs or through Freedom of Information Act requests. Lott told us that \u201cThe bottom line, at the very least is, white officers aren\u2019t shooting black suspects at a higher rate than other officers are.\u201d The federal government tracks police killings, but the available databases kept by the FBI and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are currently woefully inaccurate. Lott\u2019s study, for instance, found 1,333 more police killings from 2013 to 2015 than the FBI\u2019s database accounts for.         The most reliable data that is currently available is being compiled and made public by journalists, for example a Washington Post database of police shootings, and Fatal Encounters, a database by Nevada-based journalist D. Brian Burghart that tracks all in-custody deaths. While these databases go further than any government database currently does, they do not note the race of officers involved, and sometimes can\u2019t account for factors such as whether the person killed was mentally ill. The authors of the Lott study note that in the 2,699 deadly forces incidents they found from 2013 to 2015, the ethnicity of the officer who pulled the trigger was not known in 67 percent of the instances: The number of observations and means are shown in Tables 3 and 4. Table 3 shows that 25 percent of the suspects killed were black, 45 percent white, and 16 percent Hispanic. The remaining 14 percent were Asian, American Indian, or other. With respect to the officer\u2019s race, 29% were  white, 2% black (41 cases), 2% Hispanic (63 cases), and for 67% their race is unknown. Four percent of the officers were female (65 cases). Nick Selby, author of the 2016 book In Context: Understanding Police Killings of Unarmed Civilians, does not believe there is sufficient data to conclude that black police officers are more likely to kill black citizens, but he agrees with Lott\u2019s finding that white police officers aren\u2019t more likely to kill black suspects than their colleagues of color. Part of the problem, he said, is that in the absence of reliable government data, researchers often rely on media reports, but those reports are more likely to mention the ethnicity of an officer who kills if the officer is white and the decedent is black. The uneven reporting since Michael Brown has been that there is more intensive, more extensive reporting to the extent that we found the media was more than three times more likely to mention the race of the officer who pulled the trigger if the decedent was black, versus white or Hispanic. If the cop is white and the decedent was white, no one writes about it. (Michael Brown was an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014. His death, and the gruesome optics of his body lying uncovered in the street, resulted in weeks of civil unrest and galvanized the Black Lives Matter movement.) Selby added that his research doesn\u2019t show police target people based on race: First, in initial contacts of those unarmed civilians who ultimately died after a confrontation with police in 2015, [like Lott and Moody] we found that police did not selectively target by race. Second, based on the data we collected, it is not possible to determine whether, once contact is made, police treated black or Hispanic people differently from white people. The distinction is nuanced, and it is critical as America considers ways to consider whether there is unfair policing and biased behavior by officers. What we found in our study was that of people stopped by police in encounters that ultimately resulted in the death of an unarmed person in 2015, the ratio of blacks to whites to Hispanics was statistically the same whether police initiated the encounter or whether the encounter was initiated by a member of the community. From this we conclude that the police are not targeting for any special attention minorities.        Illustrating the controversial nature of the topic, an investigation by USA Today seemed to reveal something different. A review of 5,300 fatal police pursuits since 1999 showed that black people were more likely to be killed, both as bystanders and as suspects. Findings include:   Blacks have been killed at a disproportionate rate in pursuits every year since 1999. On average, 90 black people were killed each year in police chases, nearly double what would be expected based on their percentage of the population. Deadly pursuits of black drivers were twice as likely to start over minor offenses or non-violent crimes. In 2013 and 2014, nearly every deadly pursuit triggered by an illegally tinted window, a seat-belt violation or the smell of marijuana involved a black driver. Black people were more likely than whites to be chased in more crowded urban areas, during peak traffic hours and with passengers in their cars, all factors that can increase the danger to innocent bystanders. Chases of black motorists were about 70 percent more likely to wind up killing a bystander.   While a Michigan state police spokeswoman said the decision to flee from an officer lies on the driver, USA Today cites courts and other law enforcement agencies that lay some of the blame on the officer for making the decision to chase, even though it escalates the risk of casualties: And critics fear police are more willing to take that risk in black neighborhoods. The racial aspect of police shootings has become a political flashpoint, and for the first time in history emerged in 2016 as a talking point in a presidential race. National statistics show that black people are statistically three times more likely to die at the hands of police officers than white people are. While the ethnicity of police officers who kill civilians may be an important factor in determining systemic issues, due to the lack of data identifying the race of police officers implicated in custody deaths, we do not find that evidence currently available definitively supports the claim that black police officers are more likely to kill black civilians.

    "claim": "A video shows a vampire squid turning itself inside out, revealing sharp barbs on the underside of its hood.",
    "content": " An animated image purporting to show a vampire squid turning itself inside out, exposing a series of sharp barbs on the underside of its hood, was posted to Reddit in May 2018: The Vampire Squid, named for its blood red color, can nearly turn itself inside out to avoid predators, revealing sharp barbs on the inside of its \u201chood.\u201d  The pictured deep sea creature is a vampyroteuthis infernalis, which literally translates to \u201cvampire squid from hell.\u201d Although this name may imply that the vampire squid is some sort of nightmarish bloodthirsty beast, the claim attached to this video is false. The \u201csharp barbs\u201d on the underside of its hood are actually soft and relatively harmless. The vampire squid is also a scavenger, not a predator: In a recent article in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, Hoving and Robison show that vampire squids eat mostly \u201cmarine snow\u201d \u2014 a mixture of dead bodies, poop, and snot. The dead bodies are the remains of microscopic algae and animals that live in the waters farther up in the ocean, but sink down into the depths after they die. The poop consists of fecal pellets from small, shrimp-like animals such as copepods or krill. The snot is mostly debris from gelatinous animals called larvaceans, which filter and consume marine snow using mucus nets.         This video does show a real vampire squid (as opposed to being a CGI mock-up) but the colors in this viral footage were digitally enhanced. It was taken by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), and was featured in a 2014 video published on the YouTube page \u201cScience Friday.\u201d A slightly cropped version of this GIF can be glimpsed at the 2:30 mark of the following video:  A spokesperson for MBARI told us that the footage was taken by the organization\u2019s remotely operated vehicle Ventana on 25 April 2008, at a depth of 566 meters in Monterey Bay, California.  The vampire squid also expels bioluminescent material to confuse predators: Some large fishes and diving predators are known to eat vampire squids. Unlike shallow-water squids and octopuses, vampire squids do not expel black ink to escape predation. In the darkness of the mesopelagic zone, black or dark purple ink would not be effective. Instead the vampire squid expels a colorless substance that contains numerous particles of bioluminescent (light-producing) material. These twinkling lights confuse potential predators. It is easy to see why this creature was given the name \u201cvampire squid from hell\u201d when it was first pulled from the ocean\u2019s depths. In the ensuing years, however, researchers have discovered that this title is not very appropriate \u2014 as a matter of fact, this \u201csquid\u201d isn\u2019t even a squid at all. The vampire squid is the sole member of the Vampyromorpha order of cephalopods, and is believed to be an ancient link between the octopus and squid: Vampire squid also occupy a strange evolutionary position. They are so unusual they command their own order, a very high level of taxonomic organization. They have eight arms and fins on their head like an octopus, but they also have two long squid-like feeding filaments they use to catch and retrieve marine snow. As a result, scientists think vampire squid are extremely ancient, and may represent some of the only living descendants of the common ancestors of both octopus and squid that lived more than 200 million years ago.

    "claim": "Access to Michelle Obama's senior thesis was restricted until after the 2008 presidential election.",
    "content": " In every U.S. presidential election campaign, the two major parties\u2019 candidates become the subjects of prolonged and intense scrutiny, with seemingly everything they\u2019ve ever said or done becoming fodder for endless analysis, interpretation and criticism.  The scrutiny doesn\u2019t always stop with the candidates themselves, however \u2014 their parents, siblings, children, and other close associates sometimes find themselves the subjects of fervent investigation as well. Candidates\u2019 spouses, in particular, are often a subject of great interest.  Not only are they relatives that candidates have \u201cchosen,\u201d but they live with the candidates day in and day out, and they sometimes serve as political surrogates by stumping for their husbands or wives on the campaign trail.  They probably know the inner workings of the candidates\u2019 minds better than anyone else, and they\u2019re presumed to be important sources of advice, counsel, and influence.  All of this means that the senior thesis of Michelle Obama, wife of Illinois senator (and leading Democratic presidential contender) Barack Obama would naturally be a subject of considerable interest, especially since the subject of that thesis is itself a significant political topic.  The former Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, who graduated from Princeton University in 1985 with a B.A. in sociology (and later earned a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1988), wrote her senior undergraduate thesis on the subject of \u201cPrinceton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.\u201d Michelle Obama\u2019s thesis became a matter of controversy (outside of its subject matter) in early 2008 when some interested parties who attempted to retrieve its content were informed by Princeton that access to the thesis had been restricted until after the presidential election in November 2008. Regardless of the reasons behind it, such a restriction naturally engendered suspicion that someone or something (in this case, presumably the Obama campaign itself) had a vested interest in keeping the information from reaching the public, which in turn served to heighten interest in the contents of the thesis. The Daily Princetonian noted that prior to 26 February 2008 \u201ccallers to Mudd [Manuscript Library] requesting information on Obama\u2019s thesis were told that the thesis has been made \u2018temporarily unavailable\u2019 and were directed to the University Office of Communications,\u201d but the university lifted that restriction after the Obama campaign made a copy of the thesis available through the web site Politico. As for the content of the thesis, the Daily Princetonian summarized it thusly:  Obama, who concentrated in sociology and received a certificate in African-American studies, examined how the attitudes of black alumni have changed over the course of their time at the University. \u201cWill they become more or less motivated to benefit the Black community?\u201d Obama wrote in her thesis. After surveying 89 black graduates, Obama concluded that attending the University as an undergraduate decreased the extent to which black alumni identified with the black community as a whole. Obama drew on her personal experiences as an example. \u201cAs I enter my final year at Princeton, I find myself striving for many of the same goals as my White classmates \u2014 acceptance to a prestigious graduate school or a high-paying position in a successful corporation,\u201d she wrote, citing the University\u2019s conservative values as a likely cause. \u201cPredominately White universities like Princeton are socially and academically designed to cater to the needs of the White students comprising the bulk of their enrollments,\u201d she said, noting the small size of the African-American studies department and that there were only five black tenured professors at the University across all departments. Obama studied the attitudes of black Princeton alumni to determine what effect their time at Princeton had on their identification with the black community. \u201cMy experiences at Princeton have made me far more aware of my \u2018Blackness\u2019 than ever before,\u201d she wrote in her introduction. \u201cI have found that at Princeton no matter how liberal and open-minded some of my White professors and classmates try to be toward me, I sometimes feel like a visitor on campus; as if I really don\u2019t belong.\u201d  Much scrutiny and discussion has been focused on a single phrase contained within the thesis, the statement that \u201cblacks must join in solidarity to combat a white oppressor.\u201d  This phrase has repeatedly been quoted out of context and presented as if it reflected Michelle Obama\u2019s own philosophy, but in its full context it is clearly her speculation about what she thought some of the respondents she surveyed for her thesis (i.e., students who had attended Princeton in earlier years) might have been feeling:  As discussed earlier, most respondents were attending Princeton during the 70\u2019s, at a time when the Black Power Movement was still influencing the attitudes of many Blacks. It is possible that Black individuals either chose to or felt pressure to come together with other Blacks on campus because of the belief that Blacks must join in solidarity to combat a White oppressor. As the few blacks in a white environment it is understandable that respondents might have felt a need to look out for one another.  "

    "claim": "Police shootings kill more white Americans than Black Americans.",
    "content": " In September 2016, the ongoing issue of police shootings and race came to a head after a white police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma, shot and killed Terence Crutcher, an unarmed 40-year-old African-American man. Similar shootings throughout the U.S. have been caught on camera and widely shared via social media, prompting the development of the Black Lives Matter movement to address a seemingly constant stream of American police officers killing unarmed black people. The issue has also inspired some critics to disingenuously counter that white people are the ones who are killed most frequently by police officers, as expressed in a 21 April 2015 Washington Times article: An analysis shows that more white people died at the hands of law enforcement than those of any other race in the last two years, even as the Justice Department, social-justice groups and media coverage focus on black victims of police force. Any \u201canalysis\u201d of police killings will of course show that in absolute numbers, more white people are killed in police shootings than black people, because (non-Hispanic) whites comprise a roughly five times greater share of the U.S. population (62% vs. 13%). So any \u201canalysis\u201d that is based on nothing more than absolute numbers and does not take demographics into account is inaccurate and misleading Because the federal government doesn\u2019t keep an accurate log of police shootings, news outlets such as the Washington Post and journalists such as D. Brian Burghart have begun tracking such data independently. The Post described the statistical breakdown of fatal police shootings in 2015 thusly: According to the most recent census data, there are nearly 160 million more white people in America than there are black people. White people make up roughly 62 percent of the U.S. population but only about 49 percent of those who are killed by police officers. African Americans, however, account for 24 percent of those fatally shot and killed by the police despite being just 13 percent of the U.S. population. As The Post noted in a new analysis, that means black Americans are 2.5 times as likely as white Americans to be shot and killed by police officers. According to Fatal Encounters, the database created by former Reno News &amp; Review editor and journalism instructor Burghart (which tracks all deaths resulting from interactions with police), a total of 1,388 people were killed by police in 2015, 318 (23%) of them black, and 560 (40%) of them white. So roughly 23 percent of those killed by any police interaction in 2015 were black and just over 40 percent were white. According to those statistics (adjusted for racial demographics), black people had a 2.7 higher likelihood of being killed by police than whites. The grim trend has carried over into 2016. Of the 1,034 people killed and tracked by Burghart\u2019s Fatal Encounters database so far this year, 215 were black while 338 were white, so thus far in 2016 black Americans have been three times more likely than white people to die in interactions with police. That statistic holds for figures sent to us by Burghart compiled between Jan. 1, 2013 to Sept. 21, 2016, with suicides-by-cop removed. Burghart told us: I think it\u2019s pretty obvious that black people are killed at much higher rates than white people. I\u2019m not going to say that white people are underrepresented in these numbers, since I think all people are overrepresented in this data, but it\u2019s clear that black people are highly overrepresented. Other factors that are also prevalent in analyses of deadly use of force by police officers include age, gender, mental illness, and the circumstances of the deaths. In 250 of the fatal shootings recorded by the Post in 2015, the victims showed signs of mental illness. Men were far more often killed than women. In 782 instances, the person killed was armed with some type of \u201cdeadly weapon.\u201d In 28 instances, no record was made of the victim\u2019s race. "

    "claim": "Black cats are routinely sacrificed by \"satanic cults\" at Halloween.",
    "content": " Halloween is a festival many of our pets could do without. Our dogs and cats don\u2019t appreciate the symbolism and revelry of All Hallow\u2019s Eve; to most of them the evening is a frightening collage of trick-or-treaters and party-goers who noisily shuffle from house to house, pound on doors, and engage in a variety of mischief. Even worse, pets who remain outside on Halloween are subject to becoming the targets of pranks ranging from the comic to the cruel. Example:  Black cats, beware.  Long associated with witches, bad luck and the dark side, black felines are often used for pranks, party props and even satanic, sacrificial rituals around Halloween.  \u201cThis is a time when blood rituals take place,\u201d said Hedy Litke, director of animal placement at the ASPCA. \u201cBlack cats are often sacrificed.\u201d Such is their popularity that many shelters in New York and around the country ban adoptions of black cats in the weeks and days preceding Oct. 31 to protect them from potentially grisly endings.  Unfortunately, Halloween has also been a time when some people acquire pets \u2014 particularly cats \u2014 to use as living decorations or for displays of fun and sport, only to discard or abandon them afterwards (as often happens with chicks and rabbits at Easter time). Accordingly, many animal shelters have taken steps in recent years to limit or eliminate the adoption of cats in the days leading up to Halloween by either deferring feline adoptions until after Halloween or by more carefully scrutinizing the prospective adopters. One of the more widely-cited justifications for the implementation of more stringent adoption policies by animal shelters around Halloween is the claim that cats in general \u2014 and black cats in particular \u2014 are avidly sought by members of \u201csatanic cults\u201d who engage in the mutilation, torture, and killing of cats in celebrations associated or coincident with Halloween. That animal shelter policy has been influenced by a widespread  belief in satanic cat-sacrificing rituals at Halloween is beyond dispute; the issue here is whether such activity is really as prevalent as the belief in it is.         First of all, depending upon which source you believe, the alleged practice of sacrificing black cats began with \u201cDruid priests,\u201d \u201cpagans,\u201d or the (Christian) \u201cChurch\u201d:  More than 2,000 years ago, in the area we know now as Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales, Druid priests capitalized upon such fears by nurturing the belief that evil spirits were responsible for bringing about the advent of cold weather and shorter hours of daylight. To placate the spirits, the priests initiated a festival honoring Samhain, the lord of the dead. The festival was on Oct. 31, the day before the beginning of the Celtic new year.  This \u201cnew year\u2019s eve\u201d celebration gradually grew to ominous proportions. The priests ordered the people to extinguish all hearth fires and to gather around huge bonfires on hilltops. The fires were intended to frighten away the evil spirits and to honor the souls of people who had died during the past year. Religious rituals performed around the bonfires were followed by processions back into the villages, where embers from the large fires were used to reignite the hearth fires in each home.  The notion then developed that the souls of sinful persons, as well as all other evil spirits, were at large in the community during that night. To discourage these mysterious entities from acts of retribution, sacrifices were thrown into the bonfires. At first, the sacrifices were domesticated animals. Horses were popular because they were believed to be sacred to the Sun God, who needed attention because he was punishing the people by giving them fewer hours of daylight.  Black cats were a favorite sacrifice because they were thought to be evil spirits transformed into animals.1     Sacrificing cats began in medieval times, when the Church decreed that felines were friends of the devil. With their darting eyes and sinister-looking coats the color of death, black cats became known as witches\u2019 mascots. They also were known as \u201cfamiliars,\u201d through which witches could communicate with the spiritual world.2  (Note that we do not offer the above quotations as valid historical accounts, but merely as examples of popular contemporary explanations as to why people supposedly sacrifice black cats at Halloween.) When questioned about their October policies, most animal shelter and humane society representatives affirm their belief that steps are necessary to prevent cats from becoming sacrificial Halloween victims but offer no tangible evidence that the phenomenon is real beyond their belief in it:  \u201cAs horrible as this may sound, cats are tortured around Halloween time,\u201d said Deborah Thomas, executive director of the Maryland SPCA, which for years has enforced a virtual moratorium on black cat adoptions in the days before Halloween. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredible what people will do to cats, as if they don\u2019t have any feelings.\u201d Although concrete information on Halloween cat cruelty is hard to obtain, shelters in Maryland and across the country for years have taken special care of black cats this time of year.3     \u201cSome satanic cults sacrifice all-black or all-white cats as part of their rituals,\u201d said Nancy Suro, director of the Maxfund, a pet-adoption agency.  For the past six years, the Maxfund has called an annual October moratorium on any adoptions involving all-black or all-white cats.  Even though Suro acknowledged she doesn\u2019t know how widespread the problem is, she said: \u201cI know such activity goes on. We absolutely refuse to take any chances with these cats\u2019 lives.\u201d4  The problem \u2014 or the perception of it \u2014 follows folkloric patterns, with anecdotal reports becoming ever wider in scope.   For example, ritualistic Halloween sacrifices are said to make use of white cats as well as black cats:  Although black cats are at greater risk when it comes to cult sacrifices, white cats \u2014 because of their link to purity and virginity \u2014 have become a target in recent years.4  The problem is also said to have expanded to endanger cats of any color:  Black cats are taboo. At least that\u2019s the rule at area shelters where black felines are locked away until after the holiday. Too often cats were adopted as accessories to costumes and spooky parties, then abandoned. \u201cThere are also so-called religious groups that sacrifice animals,\u201d said Leslie Eppick of the Glendale SPCA. \u201cIf desperate, they will take any cat, no matter what color.\u201d5         The activity is said to be no longer restricted to Halloween and to occur on other \u201csatanic holidays\u201d as well:  Nicky Ratliff, executive director of Humane Society of Carroll County [Maryland], does not allow black cats to be adopted before Halloween.  \u201cNot only black cats, but also solid white cats. And not only on Halloween, but on several holidays on the satanic calendar,\u201d Ratliff said.3  The catnappings are said to be starting ever earlier in the year:  When Tina Sowers\u2019 lovable black cat, Isaiah, disappeared Oct. 5, she struggled to stay positive.  \u201cBut by the next evening it all started to sink in,\u201d said Sowers, who shares her home with five other felines, all of varying colors. Isaiah\u2019s black, it\u2019s nearly Halloween, and he\u2019s the only cat that\u2019s missing from her home.  \u201cIt\u2019s an awful thing to think about but there are people who do these things to cats around this time of year,\u201d the north Phoenix housewife said. \u201cMe and my neighbors know we have to protect our cats, but it\u2019s so early in October.\u201d6  Halloween-related animal abductions are said to not only begin as early as August, but to include several breeds of dogs as well:  Lillian Dubois-Tercero, president and executive director of Arizona Pet Line, a non-profit lost-and-found pet service in Phoenix, said that according to her computerized records, Halloween catnapping commences as early as late August.  \u201cAlready this year we have reports of 21 missing black cats, 12 white cats and 15 dogs from the end of August to October 14,\u201d she said, all within an area that runs from 51st Avenue to 32nd Street and Thomas to Cactus roads. It\u2019s also a tally that is right on target with numbers from the past three years.  \u201cThe disappearance of symbolized occult animals like black and white cats and Rottweilers, Dobermans and Great Danes starts the same time every year,\u201d she said.6  What to make of all these claims?  Contemporary news accounts are a bundle of contradictory and conflicting information.  Some veterinarians, law enforcement officials, and shelter operators assert that claims of feline sacrifices at Halloween are overblown:  Dr. Leslie Sinclair, a veterinarian who is director of companion animal care for the Humane Society of the United States, said shelters across the country ban adoptions at this time of year \u2014 or at least closely scrutinize adoption applicants.  Although many shelter operators acknowledge having little or no first-hand experience with animal sacrifices on Halloween, they have long traded tales of black cats being decapitated, disemboweled or skinned to mark the holiday. Shelter operators say pet owners should keep their pets indoors at Halloween.  But tales of widespread animal torture on Halloween might be more legend than real, Sinclair said. She said that society officials employed a clipping service to survey news accounts of feline carnage surrounding Halloween 1996 \u2014 and found nothing.  Michael F. Ryan \u2014 an investigator with the Baltimore state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office who has advised police departments on the practices of devil worshipers \u2014 said no one should fear that black cats are about to be singled out for satanic sacrifice.  \u201cIt\u2019s no more significant than a white dog, a brown dog or a polka-dotted kangaroo,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more attention people give to this myth, it just helps to ride along on a wave that takes on a life of its own. It\u2019s just not there.3         Some offer accounts that border on the ridiculous to validate their belief in satanic catnappings:  Two years ago, shelter workers at the Brooklyn Animal Resource Coalition in Williamsburg were on red alert when a woman dressed as a witch came in and insisted on adopting a black cat.  \u201cWe told her no,\u201d said BARC Vice President Vinny Spinola, whose shelter receives more than a dozen requests for black cats each Halloween and also has issued a moratorium on black-cat adoptions. \u201cWe knew she only wanted the cat for a Halloween ritual.\u201d  Litke at ASPCA recalled a spooky episode with a woman who had adopted a black cat.  \u201cWe called two days later to check on the cat, and she told us the cat was dead.\u201d  The woman wouldn\u2019t tell the ASPCA how the cat died but said workers could pick up the body.  \u201cWhen we got there, she was gone . . . and so was the cat,\u201d Litke said. \u201cAll we found was an empty apartment. We never found the body.\u201d2  Some offer scattered anecdotal accounts of black cat mutilations:  Interviews with shelter managers and a search of regional newspapers turned up nearly a dozen reports of black cat mutilations over  the past four Halloweens. Cat bones and body parts were found near a Teterboro, N.J., shelter. In Wausau, Wis., a black cat was shaved and an occult insignia was carved into its side. A black cat was burned alive in Doylestown, Ohio. In Sanford, Fla., authorities found one black cat beheaded and three others with knife wounds.7  Although no law enforcement agency or animal protection group we contacted could provide statistics about Halloween-related animal killings or abuse, the consensus is that although incidents of animal abuse may rise slightly around Halloween, it\u2019s a year-around problem, and it has far more to do with poorly-behaved kids than with organized \u201csatanic cults\u201d:  Far too often, the animals are tortured and sacrificed during pseudo satanic-based rituals.  \u201cBut not by the real religious satanic groups,\u201d [Lillian Dubois-Tercero, president and executive director of Arizona Pet Line] stressed. \u201cThey don\u2019t sacrifice cats and dogs. It\u2019s the idiot juveniles (who are) responsible who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d  Kim Hicks, spokesperson for the Arizona Humane Society, agreed that it\u2019s not religious groups such as the Wiccans that are stealing and killing animals.  \u201cWiccans are actually an anti-cruelty (to animals) group who hold animals in a higher regard than they do humans,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s more like the people who dabble in the occult who are dangerous, and my guess would be it\u2019s troubled teenagers.\u201d  The problem is magnified at Halloween time, when any unusual or unexplained animal death is automatically attributed to Halloween-related satanic activity:  Hicks cited a series of 12 to 14 cat torture and mutilation cases last fall in the Ahwatukee Foothills, five of which were confirmed by necropsies to have been killed by humans. All were thought to be perpetrated by neighborhood teens.6  Note that the article cited above refers to \u201c12 to 14 cat torture and mutilation cases\u201d but avers that only five of the cats were confirmed to have been killed by \u201chumans.\u201d  If the other seven to nine cases had not been linked to human activity, then why were they reported as incidents of \u201ctorture and mutilation\u201d?   The fact is that cats are frequently  killed by larger animals such as coyotes and through a variety of accidental means, but both types of deaths (and unexplained disappearances) are often mistakenly chalked up to the work of \u201csatanic cults\u201d and described as cases of \u201ctorture and mutilation\u201d when the deaths occur around Halloween. Some argue that, real phenomenon or not, Halloween cat sacrifices don\u2019t merit a radical change in shelters\u2019 adoption policies, because that\u2019s not where the perpetrators obtain their animals:  \u201dWe definitely get a little tighter in our adoption screening, especially the week before Halloween, and we don\u2019t allow any black-cat adoptions on Halloween day,\u201d said Karen Gnaegy, manager of the Animal Rescue and Adoption Society.  But she added: \u201dMost cults are going to get their cats off their streets. They\u2019re not going to come into a shelter and pay $40 and go through a background check.\u201d4  Are the dangers \u201csatanic rites\u201d pose to cats at Halloween time a real, widespread phenomenon, or largely a self-perpetuating Halloween myth?  What evidence we could gather was inconclusive. Certainly, though, shelters\u2019 being extra-careful with feline adoptions just before Halloween to prevent the \u201crenting\u201d of cats for decorative purposes is a prudent precaution.  If Halloween policies also help dissuade those who might inflict harm on adopted pets, so much the better. "

    "claim": "St. Patrick led the genocide of a contingent of Twa 'pygmies' from Central Africa, who were the original inhabitants of Ireland.",
    "content": " In the summer of 2019, we received renewed inquiries from readers about an unusual interpretation of the legacy of St. Patrick, one that claimed the patron saint of Ireland was responsible for the genocide of an African tribe who were purportedly the original inhabitants of that island.  The theory has given rise to many memes and social media posts that in recent years have been shared widely, especially around March 17, the feast day of St. Patrick. The memes are often accompanied by images that appear to show white men posing with African pygmies.  A typical version of the meme claims: \u201cThe Twa pygmies of Ireland, the original inhabitants. The source of [the] leprechaun legend. When you celebrate St. Patrick\u2019s Day that\u2019s the celebration of their genocide.\u201d          The theory was neatly summarized by the author and speaker B.F. Nkrumah in a widely shared Facebook video in March 2018:   The theory is not backed by any historical evidence, and as a set of factual claims, it can be dismissed. One prominent historian told Snopes it was, simply, \u201ccomplete nonsense.\u201d  The origins of the \u201cTwa\u201d theory of Irish prehistory are not entirely clear. However, it appears to be informed by what is sometimes referred to as \u201cAfrocentrism,\u201d an approach to historical study that emphasizes the role and achievements of African people in the evolution of Western civilization. The theory also seems to be influenced by euhemerism, an unusual strand of pseudohistory that was particularly popular in the 19th century. Background The Twa (or \u201cBatwa\u201d) are a people indigenous to the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. They are sometimes referred to as Twa pygmies, an anthropological term denoting their relatively short stature. Although some exact details are lacking about the life of St. Patrick, it is generally accepted among historians that he lived in the 5th Century A.D., grew up in Roman-occupied Britain (probably in Wales or the West coast of England), was kidnapped as a boy and taken to the island of Ireland as a slave for six years, then returned to Britain. He trained as a Christian cleric and went back to Ireland as a missionary.  One of the legends attached to Patrick in the centuries following his death was that he banished the snakes from Ireland. This is not based in fact. No fossil records have shown that snakes were ever indigenous to the island of Ireland, and the myth was likely a metaphor for the Christianization (and decline in paganism) for which Patrick and other early Irish saints are credited.         The earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation on the island of Ireland dates to between 10,640 and 10,860 B.C. No evidence exists to show that Twa pygmies settled the island at any point in history, beyond which it makes little sense to imagine that a traditional hunter-forager people that emerged from landlocked Central Africa would have had the geographical awareness or technical knowledge to construct and sail ships thousands of miles northwest.  Development of the theory We found several iterations of the Twa theory of Irish prehistory. One version, published in 2007 by the website of the Amen Ankh community in Kansas City, Missouri, offered the following outline: Indigo melaninated people are the original \u201cSnake Headed\u201d people of Ireland. We are the ones who were driven off (and/or slaughtered,) in the name of a Catholic \u201csaint\u201d named Patrick, who ironically wore the symbols of Ptah and Ausar. Our Black Ancestors of the east knew about the powers of all of the indigenous Herbs, Roots, and plants like Clover and Thistle. We are the first mound builders and healers all over the planet. This shines a new reference on the 1st REAL \u201cEuropeans.\u201d The Twa/Khoisan were known as elves, midgets, or pygmy (a slur on small people of African Descent) who have a history pre-dating the Greco Roman Judeo timeline history of Adam and Eve by more 200,000 years. The Ancient Twa people were nomadic, They journeyed and migrated all continents and island over the planet, spreading to Northern Ireland, Germany and the rest of Europe, and the Asian continent, and had settled in these western lands, prior to any of the influences of the Romans or later, the Roman Catholic Church. They had a cultural, technological, and philosophical impact, and influenced the establishments of societies, known as Pagans or Druids. One of the cultural influences the Druids/Twa had was the fact that they were known for their hair, who many grew into locks that looked like snakes. Much later, the Heru Loc, worn to one side of the temple, was represented in the fez or head covering that also depicted the Kemet symbols known is a Uraeus or cobra raised to strike, which is the same snake image you see worn as a Menes, by the Queens and Kings of ancient Kemet (Egypt/Nubia Ka Ma Ta). In many African cultures, the serpent is not a symbol of evil but one of eternal life, regeneration, power, protection, and wisdom. The Snake also represented the Kundalini awakening vortex found in the chakra energy traveling up our spines and the helix of our DNA. Much of this account is simply incoherent, and the only would-be evidence put forward for the claim that St. Patrick engaged in genocide against the Twa is that the knotted hairstyle of Twa and ethnic Bantu peoples bears something of a resemblance to snakes.  This is a quintessential example of pseudohistory \u2014 starting off with the requirement of proving that Twa pygmies were the original inhabitants not only of Ireland but of the whole European continent, and then retrospectively finding any available connections (even tentative symbolic links), including links to a different cultural tradition to the Central African Twa pygmies, that of ancient Egypt. This is not even to mention the unexplained and inexplicable introduction of Hindu concepts (Kundalini and chakra) into the theory. Another good example of this incoherence can be found in the same blog post\u2019s explanation of how the purported etymology of the word \u201cleprechaun\u201d establishes a link between African pygmies and the island of Ireland: \u201cThe word \u2018leprechaun\u2019 can be taken from several sources. Breaking down the syllables and removing the vowels, you can reveal the earliest Twa/Nubian/Kemetic origins: le-pr-rah ka-hn. Le (Leo/lion/king), Pr (House/temple), Re/ra-rah (Sun/Leo/lion), Ka (an attendant spirit supposedly dwelling as a vital force in a man or statue, the spiritual part of an individual believed by ancient Egyptians to survive the body after death). \u2018Kahn\u2019 is a title for a sovereign or military ruler or chief.\u201d        This is not how etymology actually works. For one thing, the purported etymological components of the word are supposed to amount to some meaning. That meaning is never provided in this case \u2014 are we to conclude that \u201cleprechaun,\u201d based on its Egyptian linguistic roots, means \u201cLion spirit in a king\u2019s house\u201d? Or \u201cSun ruler of the lion\u2019s spirit temple\u201d? The explanation fails woefully, even on its own terms.  Moreover, this etymological analysis begins with the imposition of an unacceptable and arbitrary linguistic rule (\u201cremoving the vowels\u201d), which the analysis itself promptly violates by including multiple vowels. Once again, the supposed origins of the word \u201cleprechaun\u201d are claimed to reside in ancient Egypt, not in the culture and linguistic history of the sub-Saharan Twa peoples. So even if this etymological breakdown was accurate or logical, it would establish a linguistic link between Egypt and Ireland, not the Central African Twa pygmies and Ireland. What implications would this have for the core claim that the Twa were the original settlers and inhabitants of Ireland? This type of goalpost-shifting and cherrypicking is typical of much pseudohistory, including Afrocentrist pseudohistory. In her book \u201cNot Out of Africa,\u201d the classical scholar Mary Lefkowitz described the Afrocentrist push to claim for the ancient Egyptians major intellectual innovations which belonged, in fact, to the ancient Greeks: \u201cAfrocentrism is not simply an alternative interpretation of history, offered on the basis of complex data or ambiguities in the evidence: there is simply no reason to deprive the Greeks of the credit for their own achievements. The basic facts are clear enough, at least to dispassionate observers. In effect, Afrocentrists are demanding that ordinary historical methodology be discarded in favor of a system of their own choosing. This system allows them to ignore chronology and facts if they are inconvenient for their purposes. In other words, their historical methodology allows them to alter the course of history to meet their own specific needs.\u201d  In reality, the word \u201cleprechaun\u201d is ultimately derived, relatively straightforwardly, from two roots: the Old Irish \u201cl\u00fa\u201d (\u201csmall\u201d) and \u201cchorp\u00e1n\u201d (\u201cbody,\u201d from the Latin \u201ccorpus\u201d).  Euhemerism As well as elements of Afrocentrist pseudohistory, the theory also shows signs of having been indirectly influenced by a relatively obscure pseudohistorical movement that was particularly popular in the 19th century.        Euhemerism was an approach to folklore and mythology that sought to explain popular fairy tales and myths as being ultimately grounded in historical fact. It constituted an unusual combination of rationalism (elves and fairies were not supernatural beings) with pseudohistory (the stories around them originated in an actual, historical race of pygmies that occupied parts of Europe thousands of years ago).  At least two recent accounts of the Twa theory of Irish prehistory cited a euhemerist text from 1911, \u201cRiddles of Prehistoric Times,\u201d a book written by James H. Anderson, a retired attorney from Iowa. Anderson posited a broader theory of early pygmy races being the first settlers of several parts of the world, including Ireland: \u201cThe first inhabitants of southern Europe, northern Africa, Arabia, France and the British Islands were a race of small men, who did not average in height more than about 4 feet 5 inches. They were of slight build, with dark complexion. They were cave-dwellers emanations [sic] from Lemuria [a fictional land mass in the Indian Ocean, similar to the mythical island of Atlantis] \u2026 They were an African people, and there appears evidence that they sometimes practiced cannibalism.  \u201cIt is said that the first people in Ireland were the Formatians. They were a dark, stunted race, utterly savage, using rough, unwrought stone implements. So far as can be learned, they did not know the use of fire. It is said they came from Africa on ships.\u201d Several points discredit this account and therefore any theory or historical claims based on it. Firstly, the reference to Lemuria as an actual, historical inhabited place (as opposed to a mythical land mass) is a red flag, as are Anderson\u2019s similar references to Atlantis elsewhere in the book. Moreover, Anderson refers to the \u201cFormatians\u201d as the first inhabitants of Ireland. We found no reference in any other historical accounts to such people, and the author probably intended to refer to the \u201cFomorians,\u201d who were a race of supernatural, villainous, sea-faring giants in Irish mythology. They did not exist in history.  Later in the book, Anderson described the \u201cFormorians\u201d (a misspelling) in the following way: \u201cThe ancient Irish historians tell of Ireland being settled before the flood by Formorians [sic] led by the Lady, Banblia or Kesair, her maiden name being h\u2019Erni or Berba \u2026 The Formorians [sic] were said to be descended from Noah; they lived by piracy. Their chief god was Baal, Bel, from whom Belfast was named, the god of the Sun \u2026\u201d        In reality, the place name \u201cBelfast\u201d (the capital city of present-day Northern Ireland) is derived from two Irish words: \u201cB\u00e9al\u201d (meaning mouth) and \u201cfeirste\u201d (a form of the word \u201cfearsaid,\u201d meaning \u201csand-bank ford\u201d). The river mouth in question is that of the famous River Lagan, on whose banks Belfast is located.  Those types of basic and glaring factual errors are scattered throughout Anderson\u2019s book, which also repeatedly presents mythological places and figures as having actually existed in history. Present-day versions of the Afrocentrist theory of Irish prehistory, and St. Patrick\u2019s genocide of the Twa pygmies, in particular, actually undermine their own credibility by citing accounts such as Anderson\u2019s as supportive evidence.  Several versions of the theory also cite the work of an influential euhemerist, the Scottish folklorist David MacRitchie. In particular, multiple present-day iterations of the \u201cAfrican pygmy\u201d theory of Irish prehistory refer to passages from MacRitchie\u2019s two-volume 1884 book \u201cAncient and Modern Britons,\u201d in which he laid out the theory of a race of pygmies who populated Ireland, Britain and parts of Scandinavia during the Stone Age. That theory has been discredited by the fact that no archaeological discoveries have ever substantiated it.  In one instance, MacRitchie attempted to draw inferences from the etymology of certain Irish phrases, writing: \u201cThat the wild tribes of Ireland were black men is hinted by the fact that a \u2018wild Irishman\u2019 is in Gaelic a \u2018black Irishman\u2019 (\u201cDubh Eireannach\u201d). However, the use of the word \u201cdubh\u201d in the Irish language is complicated. Literally, it means \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cdark,\u201d but it has various somewhat poetic and figurative meanings when used as a modifier and prefix, such as in the phrase \u201cDubh Eireannach.\u201d In support of his etymological proposition, MacRitchie cited an 1825 Irish dictionary published by the Scottish lexicographer Robert Archibald Armstrong. That document lists dozens of compound words using \u201cdubh\u201d as a prefix, with widely varying meanings, for example: \u201cdubh-cheist\u201d (literally \u201cblack/dark question\u201d) for \u201cpuzzle\u201d; \u201cdubh-fhocal\u201d (literally \u201cblack/dark word\u201d) for \u201criddle\u201d or \u201cparable\u201d; and \u201cdubh-bhuille\u201d (literally \u201cblack/dark blow\u201d) for a \u201cfatal blow.\u201d It would clearly be a mistake, then, to interpret a given use of the word \u201cdubh\u201d as literally meaning \u201cblack or dark in physical appearance,\u201d as opposed to having some other metaphorical sense. The very source used by MacRitchie himself establishes that much, and therefore undermines his etymological argument, as cited by many proponents of the present-day \u201cTwa pygmy\u201d theory of Irish prehistory. Moreover, even if the phrase \u201cDubh Eireannach\u201d was intended to literally mean \u201can Irishman dark in appearance,\u201d it\u2019s important to remember that racial spectrums vary between cultures, and what might have been regarded as dark complexion in Stone Age Ireland would have been described very differently indeed by an inhabitant of Africa at that time.  Conclusion The \u201cAfrican pygmy\u201d theory of Irish prehistory, and in particular the theory of St. Patrick\u2019s genocide of the Twa people, represent a fascinating, if confused and at times incoherent, jumble of various long-discredited strands of pseudohistory and euhemerized versions of Irish, Bantu, Egyptian and other mythologies.  Kairn Klieman, an associate professor of history at the University of Houston and author of a history of the Batwa pygmies of Central Africa, dismissed the theory as a \u201cmish-mash of ideas,\u201d but said it was an interesting attempt to understand the ways in which various geographically separated cultures developed similar ideas about \u201clittle people,\u201d in particular conferring on them magical and supernatural powers.  Writing by email, she told us the theory explores \u201creal similarities that exist in terms of myths about small people associated with the earth (sprites, leprechauns, mythical pygmies, mythical batwa). These myths existed since Egyptian times and there is a long intellectual history of how they came, in Western minds, to be associated with primordial humans. When the Europeans met Batwa, they unloaded all of this myth onto them.\u201d However, Klieman added that: \u201cThe idea that \u2018pygmies\u2019 or small dark people inhabited the world in ancient days is a 19th century trope that builds on the ancient myth of the pygmy in the western world.\u201d We also put the theory to D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3\u2019Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, professor of history at the National University of Ireland in Galway, and the author of a history of early medieval Ireland. His emailed response was unequivocal: \u201cComplete nonsense,\u201d he wrote.  "
