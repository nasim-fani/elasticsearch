    "claim": "From an internet advertisement: \"No One Realizes How Dangerous This Popular Vacation Spot in California Actually Is.\"",
    "content": " Internet advertisements that include phrases like \u201cyou won\u2019t believe what happens next\u201d and \u201cdoctors hate him\u201d have dominated the online landscape for years, often failing to deliver on their promises, and leaving readers clicking through endless slideshows with no payoff. One such advertisement that appeared to be clickbait showed a girl jumping into what looked like a vertical hole in a lake, with the text: \u201cNo One Realizes How Dangerous This Popular Vacation Spot in California Actually Is.\u201d The image was real, but it had nothing to do with the state of California. The photograph depicted Jacob\u2019s Well, a popular destination for swimming in Hays County, Texas. It is the second-largest fully submerged cave in the state. The image of Jacob\u2019s Well had also appeared on Reddit and Pinterest in the past. We were unable to find the name of the photographer.  The advertisement that claimed \u201cno one realizes how dangerous this popular vacation spot in California actually is\u201d was hosted by Outbrain, and the landing page after clicking the advertisement went to Icepop. Outbrain facilitated the technology that allowed Icepop to run the advertisement. However, Icepop created the content. Icepop\u2019s strategy appeared to be what has become known as advertising arbitrage. We described arbitrage in a previous story that falsely claimed \u201cJeopardy\u201d host Alex Trebek\u2019s net worth \u201cleft his family in tears\u201d following his passing. The basic idea is to make more money by displaying advertisements on each Icepop slideshow page than it had cost to run the Outbrain advertisement that led readers to the slideshow in the first place.         In the case of Jacob\u2019s Well, it appeared on page two of the slideshow, which is quite early compared to other instances of arbitrage. However, the image was quite different than the one that appeared in the advertisement, and since it did not feature California, Icepop\u2019s strategy for the advertisement may have been to keep readers clicking until they found the image from the advertisement. The image from the advertisement did not make an appearance in the slideshow story. The Hays County website described the history of Jacob\u2019s Well, including how it earned the name: Jacob\u2019s Well Natural Area consists of five land surveys that all use the spring as a corner to tie the properties together. These surveys were conducted in 1847 by a prominent surveyor names Bartlett Sims. In the early 1850\u2019s William C. Winters, a San Jacinto veteran and early settler of Wimberley, hiked up Cypress Creek searching for its source and found an overflowing spring. It is said that Mr. Winters exclaimed \u201clike unto a well in Bible times.\u201d Thus it was named \u2018Jacob\u2019s Well\u2019. The property changed hands many times over the next 100 years and became a popular recreational destination. Jacob\u2019s Well Natural Area remains a popular recreational destination today. The county also noted that the deepest part of the cavern system is 140 feet deep, and that the main cavern length is 4,341 feet. Wimberley Valley Watershed published an informative video on Jacob\u2019s Well Natural Area, which included details on its Native American history. It is true that a handful of people have drowned at Jacob\u2019s Well, but it is false that \u201cno one realizes how dangerous\u201d it is. On top of Jacob\u2019s Well being featured on Reddit and Pinterest, tales of its dangers also appeared in San Antonio Express-News, Discovery, Swimmer\u2019s Daily, All That\u2019s Interesting, and others. On Nov. 26, 1983, an Associated Press story was published in Salisbury, Maryland\u2019s, The Daily Times. It detailed a number of drownings at Jacob\u2019s Well:         In 1984, Wayne W. Russell, Jr. became the ninth fatality at Jacob\u2019s Well. Treehugger linked to a particularly frightening video that purported to show someone freediving around 100 feet (30 meters) into the water without scuba gear.      A Reddit post claimed to show a sign near the entrance to the cave below where swimmers jump into the water.  However, that sign didn\u2019t appear in any diving videos, and may have been shot at Eagle\u2019s Next Sinkhole in Florida, where multiple people have died in the past. The sign also appeared in a YouTube video from a cave dive in Mexico. In sum, Jacob\u2019s Well is a real and dangerous tourist attraction that has led to multiple drownings in the past. However, it\u2019s false to say that it\u2019s located in California, and also not true that \u201cno one\u201d is aware of its dangers. Hays County announced on its parks department phone line that Jacob\u2019s Well would be closed for the remainder of 2020 for \u201caquatic restoration,\u201d and would not reopen for swimming until May 2021.

    "claim": "A general finds a good comeback when asked about the wisdom of teaching Boy Scouts to shoot.",
    "content": " As apposite as this tale of Boy Scouts and firearms training might be, it\u2019s purely a fabrication and not an excerpt from a real interview. It began circulating on the Internet in 1999 as a quote attributed to an \u201cLTG Reinwald\u201d of the U.S. Army, it reappeared in 2001 attributed to \u201cMarine Corps General Reinwald,\u201d and it came back in 2007 in a version featuring Australian general Peter Cosgrove. When this item initially appeared in 1999, the U.S. Army denied that there was a Lieutenant General Reinwald among their ranks and chalked the whole thing up as a hoax. (Which is as logic dictated all along: if an armed forces spokesperson gave voice to a sexist remark likening a female interviewer to a prostitute in a public interview, that officer would soon be called upon to make a very public apology as well as face charges within ranks for conduct unbecoming.) National Public Radio had this to say about the matter: We are aware of an erroneous story posted on the Free Republic Website, and possibly elsewhere, which mentions a supposed interview between an unnamed NPR reporter and a U.S. Army Lieutenant General Reinwald. The story is false \u2014 the dialogue mentioned was not an NPR interview, and it never aired on any NPR program. Those who support gun rights and believe responsible gun ownership begins with teaching young people the right way to handle firearms at an early age have a great fondness for this story. As well they should, because this anecdote illustrates in a humorous way the difference between having the ability to do something and allowing that ability to dictate one\u2019s life choices.         The \u201cGeneral Reinwald\u201d story existed in joke form as far back as October 1997, when it appeared on a number of web pages in the following form:  Excerpt from a recent live radio interview on one of the regional Welsh stations: A female newscaster is interviewing the leader of a Youth club: Interviewer: So, Mr. Jones, what are you going to do with these children on this adventure holiday? Mr Jones: We\u2019re going to teach them climbing, abseiling, canoeing, archery, shooting \u2026 Interviewer: Shooting! That\u2019s a bit irresponsible isn\u2019t it? Jones: I don\u2019t see why, they\u2019ll be properly supervised on the range. Interviewer: Don\u2019t you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be teaching children? Jones: I don\u2019t see how, we will be teaching them proper range discipline before they even touch a firearm. Interviewer: But you\u2019re equipping them to become violent killers. Jones: Well, you\u2019re equipped to be a prostitute but you\u2019re not one are you? Needless to say, the interview was terminated almost immediately. Notice the differences that have taken place between the two tellings:  \u201cAbseiling\u201d has been taken out of the Americanized version (probably because whoever altered the text didn\u2019t know it was a rock climbing term meaning rappelling down rock faces). A Welsh youth club leader called simply Mr. Jones has been transformed into a named Lieutenant General in the U.S. army. Welsh children (presumably boys and girls) have become American Boy Scouts. A regional Welsh radio station has become the National Public Radio in the United States.  If there\u2019s still any doubt someone took a joke set in Wales and changed details to Americanize it, look to the Reinwald version given in the example. Although the term \u201cadventure holiday\u201d is common in Britain, it\u2019s an unlikely term for an American general to use. (Looks like whoever altered the text missed that one.) No anecdote is so good that it cannot be improved upon, and that appears to be what happened here. To give the story its proper \u201coomph,\u201d having the telling remark issue from a mere youth club leader wouldn\u2019t do. But make the man with the snappy comeback a Lieutenant General in the U.S. Army, and the story becomes ever so much more tellable. The key element of the Reinwald legend has appeared in other tales. Observe the form it took in this gender-switched version collected in 2000, which was presented as a joke and not as an event that actually happened: A couple went on vacation to a fishing resort up north. The husband liked to fish at the crack of dawn. The wife liked to read. One morning the husband returned after several hours of fishing and decided to take a short nap. Although she wasn\u2019t familiar with the lake, the wife decided to take the boat out. She rowed out a short distance, anchored, and returned to reading her book. Along came the sheriff in his boat. He pulled up alongside her and said, \u201cGood morning, Ma\u2019am. What are you doing?\u201d \u201cReading my book\u201d she replies as she thinks to herself, \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re in a restricted fishing area,\u201d he informed her. \u201cBut officer, I\u2019m not fishing. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d \u201cYes, but you have all the equipment. I\u2019ll have to take you in and write you up.\u201d \u201cIf you do that, I\u2019ll have to charge you with rape,\u201d snapped the irate woman. \u201cBut, I haven\u2019t even touched you,\u201d groused the sheriff. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut you do have all the equipment.\u201d MORAL: Never argue with a woman who knows how to read. Variations: &nbsp; In 2007 the version of this anecdote in circulation replaced the fictitious U.S. Lieutenant General Reinwald with the real General Peter Cosgrove of Australia and shifted the interview source from National Public Radio (NPR) to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).   &nbsp; &nbsp; Cummings, Jeanne. &nbsp; \"Gingrich Out to Save America.\"  &nbsp; &nbsp; The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. &nbsp; 16 January 1994 &nbsp; (p.

    "content": " A photograph of Barack Obama carrying (and presumably reading) the best-selling book, The Post-American World, is a real one, snapped by Doug Mills of the New York Times in Bozeman, Montana, in May 2008:  What does Obama read?Hussein Obama with a book in his hands. He\u2019s reading \u201cThe Post-American World\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a Muslim\u2019s view of a defeated America!  However, the characterization of the pictured book as \u201ca Muslim\u2019s view of a defeated America\u201d is erroneous: The book does not posit a \u201cdefeated America,\u201d nor does it express a Muslim point of view: The The Post-American World was written by Fareed Zakaria, an Indian-born political journalist (commonly described as a \u201cpolitical moderate\u201d) who specializes in world affairs and has written for (and edited) U.S. national news publications, hosted U.S. television news programs, and authored several books on international issues. A Village Voice profile described Zakaria (a naturalized citizen of the United States) thusly: Although he was a rising star in the serious foreign-policy world of the \u201990s (The Nation once described him as a \u201cjunior Kissinger\u201d), it was his post-9/11 Newsweek cover story \u201cWhy They Hate Us\u201d that put him on the mainstream map as someone who could make sense of the now threatening outside world. And he has continued to win himself a substantial following with his thoughtful critiques of the Bush administration\u2019s activities in Iraq. He is America\u2019s go-to man for global chaos, providing some urgently needed outside perspective on our never ending war on terror.His own upbringing was open-minded and secular; he sang Christian hymns at school and celebrated Hindu as well as his own Muslim holidays. \u201cI do know a lot about the world of Islam in an instinctive way that you can\u2019t get through book learning,\u201d he says thoughtfully, but admits he finds the role of token Muslim explainer in the American media slightly uncomfortable. \u201cI occasionally find myself reluctant to be pulled into a world that\u2019s not mine, in the sense that I\u2019m not a religious guy.\u201d         The following review (from Publishers Weekly) summarizes the thesis of The Post-American World The Future of Freedom, Zakaria describes with equal prescience a world in which the United States will no longer dominate the global economy, orchestrate geopolitics, or overwhelm cultures. He sees the \"rise of the rest\" &mdash; the growth of countries like China, India, Brazil, Russia, and many others &mdash; as the great story of our time, and one that will reshape the world. The tallest buildings, biggest dams, largest-selling movies, and most advanced cell phones are all being built outside the United States. This economic growth is producing political confidence, national pride, and potentially international problems. How should the United States understand and thrive in this rapidly changing international climate? What does it mean to live in a truly global era? Zakaria answers these questions with his customary lucidity, insight, and imagination. &nbsp;  --> When a book proclaims that it is not about the decline of America but the rise of everyone else, readers might expect another diatribe about our dismal post-9/11 world. They are in for a pleasant surprise as Newsweek editor and popular pundit Zakaria (The Future of Freedom) delivers a stimulating, largely optimistic forecast of where the 21st century is heading. We are living in a peaceful era, he maintains; world violence peaked around 1990 and has plummeted to a record low. Burgeoning prosperity has spread to the developing world, raising standards of living in Brazil, India, China andIndonesia. Twenty years ago China discarded Soviet economics but not its politics, leading to a wildly effective, top-down, scorched-earth boom. Its political antithesis, India, also prospers while remaining a chaotic, inefficient democracy, as Indian elected officials are (generally) loathe to use the brutally efficient tactics that are the staple of Chinese governance. Paradoxically, India\u2019s greatest asset is its relative stability in the region; its officials take an unruly population for granted, while dissent produces paranoia in Chinese leaders. Zakaria predicts that despite its record of recent blunders at home and abroad, America will stay strong, buoyed by a stellar educational system and the influx of young immigrants, who give the U.S. a more youthful demographic than Europe and much of Asia whose workers support an increasing population of unproductive elderly. A lucid, thought-provoking appraisal of world affairs, this book will engage readers on both sides of the political spectrum. As for what the chief executive reads in his spare time, according to deputy press secretary Bill Burton, President Obama brought the following books with him to his August 2009 vacation at Martha\u2019s Vineyard:  The Way Home by George Pelecanos, a crime thriller based in Washington, D.C. Lush Life by Richard Price, a story of race and class set in New York\u2019s Lower East Side. Hot, Flat, and Crowded by Tom Friedman, on the benefits to America of an environmental revolution. John Adams by David McCullough, a biography of the Founding Father and 2nd U.S. President. Plainsong by Kent Haruf, a drama about the life of eight different characters living in a Colorado prairie community.  In 2015, President Obama\u2019s summer reading list, as announced by the White House, included the following books:  All That Is, a novel by James Salter, whose \u201cintimately detailed novels and short stories kept a small but devoted audience in his thrall for more than half a century.\u201d All The Light We Cannot See, by Anthony Doerr, the story of a blind French girl and a reluctant German soldier whose lives converge in the French coastal town of Saint Malo. The Sixth Extinction, by Elizabeth Kolbert, a work that explores the harmful impact of humans on the planet. The Lowland, by Jhumpa Lahiri, which tells the story of two brothers in Calcutta India in the 1960s who share everything but begin to pull apart as they grow older. Between the World and Me, by Ta-Nehisi Coates, a meditation of race in America in the form of a letter from the author to his adolescent son. Washington: A Life, by Ron Chernow, the historian who penned the biography of Alexander Hamilton that the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d is based on.  "

    "claim": "Scientists have determined a date in January is statistically the most depressing day of the year.",
    "content": " You needn\u2019t be an expert in psychology to pinpoint January as one of the least enjoyable months of the year: the excitement of the holidays has concluded while related bills begin rolling in, the coming of a new year is for many people a reminder of passing time that prompts sad reflections about missed opportunities and accomplishments, no extended breaks from school or work are in the offing, and in many parts of the northern hemisphere the weather is unpleasant if not downright dangerous. It\u2019s often cold and drab out, with summer a distant memory nearly half a year away. But is any date on the calendar in January statistically the most depressing day of the year? Social media users have frequently posted about \u201cBlue Monday,\u201d a term assigned to any number of specific days in January (typically the third monday of the month). Rumors abound that a particular date (typically a Monday) has been deemed by scientists or researchers to be the most depressing of the entire year, with a number of factors influencing the calculation of this bummer of a date. Going by popular lore, you might believe we scarcely can control our level of contentment on that day given all the mathematical reasons for us to be well and truly miserable. The concept of a \u201cBlue Monday\u201d took root in 2005. In that year, a press release detailed a purported formula that calculated factors including weather, debt, time elapsed since Christmas, and unsuccessful New Year\u2019s resolutions. When those factors were combined and the \u201csadness\u201d algorithm applied to them, 24 January 2005 was identified as the single most depressing of the year. Almost immediately the claim was regarded by many as a shaky one because the cited factors were clearly vague and nearly impossible to quantify, and because of the dubious impetus behind the \u201cformula.\u201d The calculations were attributed to a Dr. Cliff Arnall of the University of Cardiff in Wales, who explained:  \u201cFollowing the initial thrill of New Year\u2019s celebrations and changing over a new leaf, reality starts to sink in,\u201d Arnall said. \u201cThe realization coincides with the dark clouds rolling in and the obligation to pay off Christmas credit card bills.\u201d The formula was devised to help a travel company \u201canalyze when people book holidays and holiday trends,\u201d said Alex Kennedy, spokesperson for Porter Novelli, a London-based PR agency. It seems that people are most likely to buy a ticket to paradise when they feel like hell. \u201cPeople feel bleak when they have nothing planned, but once they book a holiday they have a goal, they work toward having time off and a relaxing period,\u201d Kennedy said.          If that sounded a bit like a paid placement by a public relations firm working on behalf of a travel company to increase vacation sales, it\u2019s because the \u201cresearch\u201d was exactly that. By 2006, Blue Monday\u2019s roots in public relations had been fully exposed via others working in scientific fields who\u2019d been offered the same financial opportunity as Arnall (who was a part-time tutor for night students at the time):  In fact it\u2019s not surprising that these equations are so stupid, because they come from the PR companies almost fully-formed and ready to have your name attached to them. I know that because I have received an avalanche of insider stories \u2014 Watergate it isn\u2019t \u2014 including one from an academic in psychology who was offered money by Porter Novelli PR agency to put his name to the very same Sky Travel equation story that Arnall sold his to. In amongst their aggressive pitch they described how the story would go. \u201cBlue Monday \u2014 January Blues Day is Officially Announced: The 26th of January is the most depressing day in the calendar for the majority of Brits as measured by a simple mathematical formula developed on behalf of Sky Travel. \u201cBy taking into account various factors such as avg temperature (C), days since last pay (P), days until next bank holiday (B), avg hours of daylight (D) and number of nights in during mth (N), we create a formula such as C(P+B) N+D. This formula allows us to work out the day with the highest \u2018depression factor\u2019 which you can then use as a focus for making things better, booking your holiday etc \u2026\u201d This is almost exactly as it was when Arnall revealed his important work to the world.  Arnall later followed up with a corresponding \u201chappiest day of the year\u201d formula, sponsored by the Wall\u2019s ice cream company. In the intervening years, journalists and mental health professionals have taken Arnall to task for minimizing the issue of clinical depression. He later commented on his involvement with PR-as-science, amusingly objecting to other people\u2019s fabricating information to promote a claim:  Despite criticism of his decision to accept money from PR firms, he insisted he had no regrets; in the past five years, he has earned a total \u00a31,650 for identifying the two dates. \u201cThere was one comment that I had bought a really big house out of the proceeds,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople just make this stuff up.\u201d He added: \u201cI was originally asked to come up with what I thought was the best day to book a summer holiday but when I started thinking about the motives for booking a holiday, reflecting on what thousands had told me during stress management or happiness workshops, there were these factors that pointed to the third Monday in January as being particularly depressing \u2026 but it is not particularly helpful to put that out there and say \u2018there you are\u2019 \u2026 it is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy that it is the most depressing day.\u201d  While the initial Blue Monday PR campaign has long since concluded, the belief any one day in January is particularly or significantly the most depressing took on a life of its own. Not surprisingly, the claim has been repeatedly recycled by other companies seeking to promote goods or services in the post-holiday  winter period. And as social media became increasingly influential, the rumor evolved from a formula based on circumstances to an analysis of words used in tweets:  Blue Monday was originally identified in 2005 by academic Cliff Arnall, who thought it fell on the last full week of January. He calculated the date using a variety of factors including weather conditions, debt levels, failed New Year\u2019s resolutions and the number of days that had elapsed since the end of the Christmas holidays. But over the past three years, researchers analysed more than 2 million tweets posted by Britons in January looking for negative language and phrases indicating a drop in mood. They found that today, there will be nearly five times the average number of tweets relating to guilt, as people abandon their promises to pursue a healthier lifestyle.  In 2014, the Blue Monday story was reincarnated and harnessed by \u201cresearchers\u201d linked with (among other interests) an alcohol company, law firms, and a bottled water brand. In short, the specifics behind claims about January\u2019s hosting the most depressing day of the year have shifted, but the idea both originated with and is mainly advanced by marketers and public relations firms. No studies or evidence have proved any one calendar date is more gloomy than any others, and the formula linked with the calculation of such a date has no real scientific basis. Critics have noted that assigning arbitrary or transient causes (such as the arrival bills or the end of Christmas vacation) to clinical depression could adversely impact its sufferers by tacitly suggesting the condition is treatable through methods as simple as booking a vacation or buying a drink.

    "claim": "Consumers should be aware of plastic rice from China that is difficult to discern from \"real rice.\"",
    "content": " Since early 2011, social media rumors have asserted plastic rice was being manufactured in China, exported, and consumed by people in other countries unaware the rice they were eating was in fact not a food at all. In February 2011, Raw Story and The Mary Sue published items about the purported plastic rice controversy, both articles noteing that the claims were not substantiated: Various reports in Singapore media have said that Chinese companies are mass producing fake rice made, in part, out of plastic, according to one online publication Very Vietnam \u2026 \u201cA Chinese Restaurant Association official said that eating three bowls of this fake rice would be like eating one plastic bag. Due to the seriousness of the matter, he added that there would be an investigation of factories alleged to be producing the rice,\u201d Very Vietnam noted. The \u201crice\u201d is made by mixing potatoes, sweet potatoes and plastic. The potatoes are first formed into the shape of rice grains. Industrial synthetic resins are then added to the mix. The rice reportedly stays hard even after being cooked \u2026 About 300,000 people were injured and at least six infants died in 2008 when Chinese milk and infant formula was found to be adulterated with melamine, which was thought to help the milk pass nutrition tests. Later that year, melamine was also discovered in Chinese eggs. In what is the most diabolical thing I have read today, a report from Very Vietnam alleges that some Chinese food producers are creating synthetic rice out of potatoes, sweet potatoes, and plastic. The \u201crice\u201d is made by mixing the potato material together, shaping it into grains, and then adding an \u201cindustrial resin\u201d as a binding agent. Very Vietnam says that these resins can be very harmful if eaten \u2026 \u201cA Chinese Restaurant Association official said that eating three bowls of this fake rice would be like eating one plastic bag.\u201d The obvious motivation behind this scheme would be money, since the synthetic \u201crice\u201d is cheaper to produce. This is just another, albeit somewhat more disquieting, in the long line of tainted or defective products apparently coming out of China. These would include the poisonous drywall, and tainted milk. If true, this [is] a cruel, calculated maneuver[.] Between 2011 and 2016 the story intermittently made the social media rounds, losing even the very basic details from unfounded reports that the faux food was purportedly fabricated from other edible starches (such as sweet potato or potato) and distilling it simply to an issue of \u201cplastic rice.\u201d In October 2016, the claim recirculated on Facebook and inspired blog posts anew, such as verbatim details of the years-old claim reproduced on alternative health blogs: Research has shown that certain rice factories in China have been producing a \u201cfake rice substitute\u201d in place of the popular and more expensive Wuchang rice, for greater profit. According to the Korean Times, this food fraud is being created using a mixture of potatoes, sweet potatoes, and synthetic resin (plastic). These ingredients are mixed together and formed into \u201cgrains\u201d which very closely resemble the appearance of actual grains of rice. The rice substitute is then sprayed with a fragrance to mimic the smell of Wuchang rice, making it difficult to decipher between the two versions. As you would expect, consuming this \u201cplastic rice\u201d is extremely harmful and toxic to one\u2019s health, and is causing quite an uproar. One Chinese official warned that eating three bowls of this man-made rice would be equivalent to ingesting one plastic bag.         Perennial plastic rice rumors bear all the hallmarks of a standard \u201cfood from China\u201d panic, including identical claims rehashed year in and out without substantiation. The \u201cChinese Restaurant Official\u201d is always warning that consuming the purported product is akin to eating a plastic bag and asserting that the motive behind the food fakery is cynically financial (without offering any proof that it\u2019s cheaper to go to the trouble of making plastic rice than growing real rice). Another marker of panic over fabricated food from China is the existence of multiple videos purportedly depicting the shady manufacturing of fake rice in factories: At roughly the 1:40 mark, an individual\u2019s hand enters the frame to manually sift the \u201cgrains of rice.\u201d However, the product produced looks way too thick to pass as rice anywhere (commenters surmised the substance shown was actually non-food pellet filling). Language barriers are often effective in advancing such rumors, because unrelated videos can easily be labeled as \u201cproof\u201d of untoward practices when most viewers can\u2019t understand the audio content of the clips. The repurposed video angle was at the forefront of another Chinese export panic involving labor intensive wax cabbage, proffered via a video clip swiped from an Asian television show about making \u201cdisplay food\u201d which is not intended for consumption. And like the plastic rice rumor, the wax cabbage claim circulated bearing the implausible assumption that people would carry on unaware the salad they were eating tasted like a candle, or their rice had a styrofoam-y mouthfeel. The earliest and primary versions of the plastic claim hinged on \u201creports,\u201d alleged investigations, information that was scary \u201cif true,\u201d rice fabrication that \u201cit [was] thought\u201d occurred, and the sort of content which tends to make a \u201cbetter safe than sorry\u201d impression on readers without the need for any rigorous followup. Naturally, the plastic rice claims perpetually played well on social media pages devoted to food sanctimony with or without substantiation. When the claims were new in early 2011, they essentially represented a rumor which had filtered into non-English news sources from an unsubstantiated single report, with no clear evidence presented to suggest plastic rice was real or a known risk. An extant Wikipedia page (littered with clear signs of editorial neglect) lists plastic rice as an \u201cimitation food,\u201d but its citations are largely newer iterations of the old unproven rumor. By May 2015, the plastic rice rumor had hit a fever pitch in Indonesia. One English-language source reported on the initial panic \u2014 and that testing had revealed the claim was false: On May 16, the Harian Terbit newspaper published an article warning that China was producing fake rice. The report urged Indonesians to be vigilant, although it admitted there was no certainty that plastic rice was being circulated in Indonesia. On the same day, MNC Media\u2019s Global TV broadcast the YouTube video and claimed the factory was making fake rice \u2014 despite not having a shred of evidence to prove its allegation. Later, Metro TV aired the same video, claiming it showed a counterfeit rice factory \u2026 All of this \u2018news\u2019 of fake rice filtered through to the community. On May 18, a rice porridge vendor from the West Java city of Bekasi, Dewi Septiani (29), declared she had unwittingly purchased and consumed some plastic rice. She had bought six litres of rice on May 13 from a vendor at Tanah Merah traditional market for Rp.8,000 per litre. She claimed the rice did not turn into proper porridge but instead became congealed, making her, her younger sister and nephew sick after they ate it. Having seen the YouTube clips and the news reports, she assumed they must have consumed synthetic rice. Police questioned the vendor and one of his suppliers and closed his shop. Dewi\u2019s porridge shop was also closed pending investigations. On May 20, samples of the rice \u2014 including some cooked by Dewi \u2014 were taken by police for tests, conducted separately by state-owned certification company Sucofindo, the National Police, the National Agency of Drug and Food Control (BPOM), the Trade Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry \u2026 Sucofindo was quick to announce the results of its tests, on May 21 claiming the rice contained traces of polyvinylchloride (PVC), a synthetic compound which is usually used to make pipes. Specifically, it had found traces of three types of plasticizers used in the manufacture of PVC: benzylbutylphthalate (BBP), 2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and diisononyl phthalate (DINP). It did not state the percentages of the synthetic materials it had found. Meanwhile, lazy reporters found an old online news article from South Korea from 2011, claiming that rice made out of plastic was being \u201cmassively\u201d sold in China. The report, citing unnamed media sources from Singapore, said \u201cplastic rice is made by forming potatoes and sweet potatoes into rice-like shape, then adding industrial synthetic resins.\u201d It warned that \u201ceating three bowls of plastic rice is the same as eating one vinyl bag\u201d \u2026 These \u2018facts\u2019 quickly made their way into Indonesian and Malaysian media reports. Even before Sucofindo had released its results, the Jakarta division of hip regional city news network Coconuts.co on May 20 proclaimed: \u201cPlastic rice is real, as shown in this video of its production in a Chinese factory.\u201d Oh dear. An accompanying article on http://jakarta.coconuts.co claimed \u201cthis video at least confirms that plastic rice is a real thing\u201d. Utter garbage. On May 26, National Police chief General Badrodin Haiti, after a meeting with the president and other top officials, announced that all of the other tests were negative, so there never had been any plastic rice. He advised the public to stop panicking over the issue \u2026 So why had Sucofindo come up with different results? Badrodin said Sucofindo may have been using different analysis methods or contaminated equipment. BPOM head Roy Sparingga confirmed that his agency had found no synthetic polymers or heavy metals in the rice. He said the World Health Organization\u2019s International Network of Food Safety Authorities had informed BPOM there were no recent cases of synthetic rice in other countries. Trade Minister Rachmat Gobel said his counterparts in China and Malaysia had assured him there was no fake rice in distribution in their countries. In November 2015, the Jakarta Post reiterated that notions of markets rife with synthetic rice were a public panic or \u201choax,\u201d not a legitimate health concern. The same alleged incident with the same porridge vendor was found to have escalated fear of plastic rice, leading to an entrenched belief the staple food was making Indonesians sick: The Jakarta Police have said they have halted an investigation into rice that had been claimed to contain dangerous plastics, as laboratory results had shown the rice samples contained no such materials. Jakarta Police special crime director Sr. Comr. Mujiyono said that based on an examination conducted by the National Police central forensics laboratory (Puslabfor), the Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM), and the Agriculture Ministry\u2019\u0080\u0099s research and development unit (Balitbang), the police had concluded that the allegations were erroneous \u2026 In May, state-owned survey company Sucofindo confirmed that rice samples taken from the Bekasi store contained polyvinyl chloride (PVC) usually found in plastic pipes, as well as a plasticizer chemical substance usually found in hydraulic tools and electric capacitors. It announced that the substances could cause kidney, liver, lung problems and cancer if consumed. Nonetheless, the government countered the statement some days later, announcing that a round of official laboratory tests by the BPOM, the Trade Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry had found no plastic substances in the rice samples, which were suspected to have been imported from China. At [a November 2016] press conference, Puslabfor chemistry and biology division representative Sr. Comr Sabran Subandi said that the report also unsettled many other Bekasi residents and the Bekasi police had received many reports regarding artificial rice \u2026 According to him, people had reported their suspicions when they felt sick after consuming the rice \u2026 He said that the police immediately took action on the reports by testing samples of rice in the areas where complaints were made. They did not find any plastic substances in the samples. \u2018\u0080\u009cAs we all know, many people get sick every day. After Dewi\u2019\u0080\u0099s report, cases of sick people seemed to be automatically connected to plastic rice,\u2019\u0080\u009d Sabran said. \u2018\u0080\u009cHowever, they could have been sick for many other reasons.\u2019\u0080\u009d        As of October 2016, the plastic rice panic was still going strong both in and outside the United States. A 17 October 2016 article in The Hindu lamented the routine belief such blatant adulteration was common in spite of food safety regulation processes: Had it not been for the social media, the \u2018Chinese egg\u2019 would not have attained its current notoriety. Similar were the cases of fumes emanating from fish or of plastic rice entering the market or dye being injected into watermelons. Unfortunately, all such reports reached the electronic media and certain sections of the print media, almost confirming people\u2019s fears over instances they saw first on social media. However, why the same social media or the mainstream media did not give much space to reports exposing the hoax remains unclear. The same media which spread the hoax earlier should take the responsibility of clearing the air, believe people with scientific authority and temperament. \u201cOrdinary people are misguided by such videos and news,\u201d says Thomas Biju Mathew, professor and head of the pesticide laboratory of the Kerala Agricultural University. He was involved in a series of tests regarding the \u2018Chinese eggs\u2019 and other issues. \u201cThe social media, instead of complementing our lives, is now almost a disease,\u201d he adds. Dr. Mathew takes a serious view of the fake news spreading through the media and says the government should come up with some cyber law to tackle the problem because it is a crime to create fear and confusion. There are methods to zero in on persons spreading unverified news regarding prominent persons. The methods should be utilised to find the source of fake news as well, he adds. The government has facilities to check any aspect of food adulteration and contamination, and Food Safety offices and inspectors are available in all districts. People should alert Food Safety officials if any such issue occurs in their locality or if they come across a message or news warning of such dangers, says K.V. Shibu, Assistant Commissioner, Food Safety, Ernakulam. Much like soy sauce purportedly made from human hair, the above-mentioned wax lettuce, or warnings about crabs, pork, tilapia, chicken, and garlic exported from China, the plastic rice rumor served as a socially acceptable manner in which people could express reservations about exotic or culturally unpalatable ingredients in Chinese exports (rather than a legitimate health or safety concern). Such legends and rumors antedate their social media format, although before Facebook they tended to manifest in the form of cat and dog meat-stocked freezers or bodily fluids lurking in Chinese takeout, all of which carried the underlying message that Chinese-made goods were not to be trusted. And despite the new life breathed into it by Twitter, Instagram, and other platforms, the base rumor was one of the oldest in circulation. Versions were traced back as far as the 1850s, with one example from 1948 on a snopes.com page explaining why such rumors have tremendous resilience in Western countries: Ancient slur or not, wherever this rumor goes it affects how the locals feel about the Chinese in their midst \u2026 As an example (this rumor has turned up in so many cities, it would be impossible to list them all), in 1995 the closing of two Chinese restaurants in Columbus, Ohio, awakened the sleeping rumor yet again. Calls were fielded, both by the local paper and the board of health, about whispers that these closings were the result of dead cats\u2019 being discovered in each eatery\u2019s meat locker. Never mind that just the previous day the local paper had run a story about the closure (for business reasons) of all 51 restaurants in this particular chain \u2014 the cat meat rumor would not be denied. [The adulterated Chinese food] legend is a classic example of xenophobia (fear and hatred of foreigners or that which is foreign). Asian culture is markedly different from Western culture, with language but the first barrier to be hurdled. Customs, religious observances, traditions \u2014 all are wildly different from their North American counterparts. As with all xenophobic reactions, that which isn\u2019t the same is vilified. The Asian culinary practice of making a tiny bit of meat stretch to feed a family by cutting it up fine and making it part of a larger dish of vegetables or noodles is transformed by fear into a vehicle for \u201cthem\u201d to slip something objectionable into our unwitting stomachs. Likewise, that the Chinese don\u2019t as a rule keep cats and dogs as pets becomes seen as a willingness to plop someone else\u2019s animal companion into the stew pot. Anything for a buck, says this legend, and if in the process one puts over on the white devils, so much the better. Since the appearance of plastic rice rumors in 2011, we have been unable to locate any substantiated reports that anyone successfully passed off plastic rice off as the real thing regularly (or ever) in any of the countries in which the rumor took root. As a case study from Indonesia illustrated thoroughly, the rumor was self-promoting: one woman exposed to the plastic rice rumor became ill and presumed the fake food she\u2019d heard about was to blame. Faulty initial testing cemented the belief, and soon many people were attributing all illnesses to the specter of plastic rice. A few follow-up items reported that thorough testing had revealed the rice in question was not plastic or was simply adulterated, yet the claim went on to make the alternative health rounds in October 2016 unencumbered by the debunkings. All versions stemmed from one shaky item published in January 2011 and plastic rice  lived in realm of legend until 21 December 2016, when the BBC published an article reporting that the notorious faux foodstuff had been \u201cseized in Nigeria.\u201d Although the headline said plastic rice had affirmatively been discovered, the article suggested otherwise: Nigeria has confiscated 2.5 tonnes of \u201cplastic rice\u201d smuggled into the country by unscrupulous businessmen, the customs service says \u2026 Lagos customs chief Haruna Mamudu said the fake rice was intended to be sold in markets during the festive season. The BBC\u2019s Peter Okwoche says it is the only foodstuff that crosses cultural and ethnic lines across the country. Whoever made this fake rice did an exceptionally good job \u2013 on first impression it would have fooled me. When I ran the grains through my fingers nothing felt out of the ordinary \u2026 But when I smelt a handful of the \u201crice\u201d there was a faint chemical odour. Customs officials say when they cooked up the rice it was too sticky \u2013 and it was then abundantly clear this was no ordinary batch. They\u2019ve sent a sample to the laboratories to determine exactly what the \u201crice\u201d is made of. They are also warning the public not to consume the mystery foodstuff as it could be dangerous. Fake food scandals are thankfully rare in Nigeria when you compare it to countries such as China. As of the 21 December 2016 report, the \u201cplastic\u201d rice seized in Nigeria was en route to be tested and its composition unconfirmed. The customs chief\u2019s statement about unsavory businessmen preying on holiday shoppers suggested he was previously aware of the rumor, as did the BBC\u2019s reference to myriad \u201cfake food scandals\u201d in China (which have been almost entirely fictitious, as noted above). It was possible a batch of rice tainted by chemicals or otherwise not fit for consumption was presumed to be the legendary plastic rice by folks exposed to the years-old rumor, or that the rice was in some manner counterfeit. However, the nature of the grains remained in question, and the scenario seemed likely to be an instance of ostension (or pseudo-ostension). On 24 December 2016, Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Health announced that tests on the \u201cplastic rice\u201d had revealed the rice was in fact not plastic: In [a] statement, Yetunde Oni, acting director-general of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), who briefed minister, was quoted to have said that preliminary findings by the agency failed to validate the claim by the NCS. \u201cFollowing the reports on the seizure of \u2018alleged plastic rice\u2019, NAFDAC team of inspectors led by the Director Ports Inspection Directorate(PID) and Director laboratory services visited the Area Comptroller\u2019s Office, Ikeja, Lagos and drew samples from the seized consignment for laboratory analysis,\u201d Oni said. \u201cThe products were in 25kg pack size with no NAFDAC number, batch details and manufacturing details of address of manufacture and date markings. \u201cThe following preliminary tests and results were found to be in conformity with the specification for rice: Floating\u200a\u2014\u200anegative, cooking\u200a\u2014\u200anormal, odour\u200a\u2014\u200anormal, colour- off-white rice grains , moisture -13.0 , pre-ashing\u200a\u2014\u200anormal.\u201d The plastic rice story (and its fellow counterfeit Chinese food export legends) resemble an internationally viral 2007 CCTV segment about pork buns purportedly made with scrap cardboard, for which an independent journalist was eventually detained and accused of faking the oft-referenced story.

    "claim": "NASA issued a warning that Earth could be hit by an asteroid around Christmas 2019. ",
    "content": " On Oct. 23, 2019, the U.K. tabloid Express published an article that left some readers believing they need not make Christmas plans this year because Earth was in danger of being hit by a large asteroid:  The article was entitled \u201cAsteroid terror: NASA spot mammoth space rock to hit Earth\u2019s orbit five days before X-mas.\u201d The subheading gave earthlings an even smaller chance of survival: \u201cAN ASTEROID the size of the World Trade Centre is on a dangerous Earth-bound orbit that could see the rock smash the planet during Christmas festivities.\u201d When the article was regurgitated by even less-reputable websites, the fear-mongering title morphed into a factually inaccurate claim. For instance, the website Digital Wise rehashed this article under the title \u201cNASA Issues Warning Over Asteroid Predicted To Hit Earth Five Days Before Christmas!\u201d NASA has made no such announcement, and Earth is not in danger of being hit by an asteroid around Christmas.          These articles are all based on a real asteroid (known as 216258 2006 WH1) and its holiday approach toward Earth. However, these articles present the information as if this asteroid is particularly dangerous. But there\u2019s nothing unusually threatening about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1. NASA\u2019s Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) currently lists 26 near-Earth objects that are scheduled to pass by our planet within the next 60 days. While asteroid 216258 2006 WH1 (which was discovered in 2006) will truly be passing by earth around Christmas, CNEOS reports that the asteroid is expected to safely pass by earth at a distance of about 15.19 LD (lunar distance), approximately 3.6 million miles. Dr. Paul W. Chodas, the Director of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, told us in an email that there is \u201cnothing unusual or dangerous\u201d about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1: No, there is nothing unusual or dangerous about this asteroid. It is simply making a close approach to the Earth. Astronomers have been observing this asteroid\u2019s position for 13 years, we know its orbit very accurately, we can predict its close approaches accurately for the next 200 years, and we know with certainty that it cannot hit our planet. Lindley Johnson, NASA\u2019s Planetary Defense Officer and Program Executive of the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO), also told us that this asteroid \u201cposes no hazard to impacting earth\u201d:  NASA and other US agencies are lead players in the international effort to develop plans to respond to a possible Near-Earth Object (NEO) impact. In 2018, the White House released the National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan, which identifies key steps that US agencies need to take to better prepare the United States\u2014and the world\u2014for detecting and responding to a possible impact. NASA has been directed by Congress to catalogue and characterize all NEOs bigger than 140 meters, the ones that could be catastrophic. NASA is approximately 35% complete for NEOs 140 meters and larger, and approximately 96% complete for those 1 km and larger. Strategic investments in our space-based programs will lead to the benefit of all of humanity as we continue to catalogue any NEOs that pose a potential threat. This particular asteroid\u2019s trajectory has been well tracked by NASA\u2019s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies since it\u2019s discovery 13 years and poses no hazard to impacting Earth. Here\u2019s a little more information about near-earth objects from CNEOS. The organization writes on its website (emphasis ours):  On a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth\u2019s surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earth\u2019s surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago. With an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earth\u2019s surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth\u2019s atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth\u2019s surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories \u2026 \u2026 No one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.        NASA Near-Earth Object Observations Program is constantly monitoring the skies for approaching asteroids and meteors. So far, the program has discovered more than 19,000 NEOs. When NASA discovers an NEO, it works to determine as much information as possible about the object, such as its size, speed, and orbit, so that the agency can calculate when it will approach Earth and how close it will come when it does.  But the 19,000 NEOs in NASA\u2019s database aren\u2019t really what we have to worry about. The organization writes that thousands of NEOs have yet to be discovered: Asteroid impacts are a continuously occurring natural process. Every day, 80 to 100 tons of material falls upon Earth from space in the form of dust and small meteorites (fragments of asteroids that disintegrate in Earth\u2019s atmosphere). Over the past 20 years, U.S. government sensors have detected nearly 600 very small asteroids a few meters in size that have entered Earth\u2019s atmosphere and created spectacular bolides (fireballs). Experts estimate that an impact of an object the size of the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 \u2013 approximately 55 feet (17 meters) in size \u2013 takes place once or twice a century. Impacts of larger objects are expected to be far less frequent (on the scale of centuries to millennia). However, given the current incompleteness of the NEO catalogue, an unpredicted impact \u2013 such as the Chelyabinsk event \u2013 could occur at any time. Still, the chances of an asteroid larger than 140 meters hitting earth in the next 100 years is minimal: The current congressionally directed objective of the NEO Observations Program is to find, track, and characterize at least 90 percent of the predicted number of NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size\u2013larger than a small football stadium\u2013and to characterize a subset representative of the entire population. Objects of this size and larger pose a risk to Earth of greatest concern due to the level of devastation an impact would cause, and should continue to be the focus of global search efforts. While no known asteroid larger than 140 meters in size has a significant chance to hit Earth for the next 100 years, less than half of the estimated 25,000 NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size have been found to date. Asteroid 216258 2006 WH1 will pass by Earth a few days before Christmas. However, NASA has issued no warnings about a catastrophic impact, and CNEOS reports that this asteroid will get no closer than 3 million miles from Earth during its approach.  "

    "claim": "A marijuana bill introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives during the 116th Congress is numbered H.R. 420 \u2014 a reference to marijuana culture. ",
    "content": " On 9 January 2018, U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, a Democrat from Oregon, introduced a bill popularly termed the \u201cRegulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act.\u201d The bill \u201cwould take marijuana off the federal controlled substances list and establish a nationally regulated industry overseen by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\u201d The number assigned to this proposed legislation was H.R. 420, a number frequently referenced in cannabis culture. This number, steeped in legend and rumor, most commonly refers to a time to light up during the day (4:20), or as an informal marijuana holiday on April 20th (4/20).  That the Congressional bill was given the number 420 was no coincidence, according to Blumenauer, who is the founding member of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus. Speaking to the Oregon newspaper paper Willamette Week, he said of that designation: \u201cWhile the bill number may be a bit tongue-in-cheek, the issue is very serious. Our federal marijuana laws are outdated, out of touch and have negatively impacted countless lives. Congress cannot continue to be out of touch with a movement that a growing majority of Americans support. It\u2019s time to end this senseless prohibition.\u201d This is not the first time that marijuana legislation has come with the number 420, either. California Senate Bill 420, signed into law in 2003, formalized that state\u2019s medical marijuana program. A bill to legalize marijuana in Rhode Island introduced in 2017 was numbered 420 as well, although that legislator told reporters the number was a coincidence. When the U.S. House of Representatives voted unsuccessfully to block the Department of Justice from interfering with state medical cannabis laws in 2003, that vote was given the number Roll Call 420.

    "content": " The ability of a single image to influence and shape history has long been a part of American politics. Even before there was a United States of America, Paul Revere\u2019s masterful \u2014 and grossly inaccurate \u2014 engraving of the Boston Massacre helped solidify colonial support for a break with Great Britain. In more recent times, specific images from presidential campaigns have been deemed instrumental in deciding the outcomes of elections.  Lyndon Johnson\u2019s infamous 1964 \u201cdaisy\u201d commercial, although aired only once, helped crystallize the image of Republican opponent Barry Goldwater as a dangerous, hot-headed militant. The sight of Edmund Muskie\u2019s breaking down as he defended his wife\u2019s honor outside the offices of Manchester Union Leader almost certainly cost him the 1972 Democratic nomination for president. And video footage of 1988 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis\u2019 attempting to show his support for the military by riding around in a tank while popping his head up and down in a \u201cSnoopy-like\u201d manner was the object of so much derision that opponent George Bush\u2019s campaign incorporated it into an anti-Dukakis commercial. Images are easily manipulated, however, and President George H.W. Bush (father of President George W. Bush) found himself the victim of one during his failed re-election bid in 1992. The fun began during a primary season photo opportunity on 5 February, as President Bush dropped by a National Grocers Association convention in Orlando. One of the exhibits Bush visited was a demonstration of NCR\u2019s checkout scanning technology, an event New York Times reporter Andrew Rosenthal turned into a chiding front page story about Bush\u2019s lack of familiarity with the details of ordinary life in America:  Today, for instance, [Bush] emerged from 11 years in Washington\u2019s choicest executive mansions to confront the modern supermarket.Visiting the exhibition hall of the National Grocers Association convention here, Mr. Bush lingered at the mock-up of a checkout lane. He signed his name on an electronic pad used to detect check forgeries. \u201cIf some guy came in and spelled George Bush differently, could you catch it?\u201d the President asked. \u201cYes,\u201d he was told, and he shook his head in wonder. Then he grabbed a quart of milk, a light bulb and a bag of candy and ran them over an electronic scanner. The look of wonder flickered across his face again as he saw the item and price registered on the cash register screen. \u201cThis is for checking out?\u201d asked Mr. Bush. \u201cI just took a tour through the exhibits here,\u201d he told the grocers later. \u201cAmazed by some of the technology.\u201d Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, assured reporters that he had seen the President in a grocery store. A year or so ago. In Kennebunkport. Some grocery stores began using electronic scanners as early as 1976, and the devices have been in general use in American supermarkets for a decade. Editorial writers were quick to seize on the notion that President Bush\u2019s \u201camazement\u201d demonstrated he had never seen a supermarket scanner before and criticized him for being out of touch with the daily concerns of ordinary Americans: [The Boston Globe, 1992] President Bush, according to reporters who followed him around Tuesday at the National Grocers Association convention in Orlando, Fla., had never before seen a supermarket cash register on which the name of the item and its price flashed on a screen when the item was dragged across an electronic scanner. The scanner was introduced at supermarket checkouts in 1980, the year Bush was elected vice president, and is just one of the many aspects of everyday life from which a president (or vice president) is shielded in the private life of public office. Like getting money out of a bank with an ATM card. Or going down to a local video store to rent a movie. Even trying to figure out how much four 29-cent stamps cost. With a Secret Service agent driving the car, there is probably no chance to play around with the station scanner on the car radio. And with a switchboard in the basement, there is certainly no need to figure out which long-distance telephone service to sign up with. And the operators handle any telemarketing calls. Somebody else handles the recycling \u2013 before 1980 that was called \u201ctaking out the trash\u201d \u2013 and is responsible for separating the plastic bottles from the glass jars and taking the biodegradable grocery bags back to the supermarket. Maybe there will be time next year to try some of these things. After 12 years\u2019 vacation from the real world, there will be a lot of catching up to do.  [Lewis, 1992] When President Bush expressed amazement last week at a supermarket\u2019s electronic checkout scanner, he was ribbed for being so out of touch with American life. Commentators went on to remark that high government officials as a group, with their chauffeured lives, are cushioned from reality. Fair enough. But the episode of the President and the unfamiliar supermarket suggests a broader point, a much more serious one. Upper-income Americans generally, whether in public or private employment, live not just a better life but one quite removed from that of ordinary families. They hardly experience the problems that weigh so heavily today on American society. And that fact has dangerous political consequences. Health care, for example. The possibility of serious illness without insured care is now said to be the number one worry of Americans: not just the 30 million without any health insurance but the many millions more who have inadequate coverage or who are afraid to change jobs lest they lose protection. President Bush does not have those concerns. He gets socialized medicine: care at public expense. Congressmen and other top officials may also be treated in government hospitals. Nor is health insurance likely to be a concern for private Americans with incomes in the top 20 percent. Comprehensive coverage goes with the territory for them.         Then the details of the story started to dribble out. Andrew Rosenthal of The New York Times hadn\u2019t even been present at the grocers\u2019 convention. He based his article on a two-paragraph report filed by the lone pool newspaperman allowed to cover the event, Gregg McDonald of the Houston Chronicle, who merely wrote that Bush had a \u201clook of wonder\u201d on his face and didn\u2019t find the event significant enough to mention in his own story. Moreover, Bush had good reason to express wonder: He wasn\u2019t being shown then-standard scanner technology, but a new type of scanner that could weigh groceries and read mangled and torn bar codes.  The New York Times then defended Rosenthal\u2019s original article by reviewing videotape of the event and proclaiming that both ordinary and newfangled scanners had been demonstrated for President Bush, and that he was clearly \u201cunfamiliar with\u201d and \u201cimpressed\u201d by the former: But a videotape of the encounter last Tuesday shows that Mr. Bush seemed unfamiliar with even basic scanner technology. Shown an ordinary scanner, he was clearly impressed.The incident occurred on a visit to the National Grocers Association conference in Orlando, Fla., last Tuesday. Robert Graham, an executive with the NCR Corporation, showed Mr. Bush a scanner and said: \u201cOf course, this looks like a typical scanner you\u2019d see in a grocery store.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d the President responded. \u201cThere\u2019s one big difference,\u201d Mr. Graham added, and lifted the plastic screen over the glass through which the codes are scanned to show that a grocery scale was built into the device. But Mr. Bush seemed more interested in the scanner. Pointing to the scanning window, he asked, \u201cYou cross this, this open place?\u201d Mr. Graham nodded, so Mr. Bush passed a drink carton over the window and looked up when the price showed up on the cash register display. After that, Mr. Graham tried to show Mr. Bush the new scanner that can read mangled bar codes, but he had to wait because Mr. Bush was still trying the basic model. The President passed a bag of candy over the window and then pointed at the register, shaking his head with wonder when the price appeared with a beep. After that, Mr. Graham showed Mr. Bush the new scanner, and the President was also impressed with that. Later, Mr. Bush said he had been \u201camazed by some of the technology.\u201d  The New York Times seemed to be one the only major print medium to take this view of the event, however. Newsweek screened the same tape and reported: \u201cBush acts curious and polite, but hardly amazed.\u201d Michael Duffy of Time magazine called the whole thing \u201ccompletely insignificant as a news event. It was prosaic, polite talk, and Bush is expert at that. If anything, he was bored.\u201d And Bob Graham of NCR, who demonstrated the scanner technology for President Bush, said, \u201cIt\u2019s foolish to think the president doesn\u2019t know anything about grocery stores. He knew exactly what I was talking about.\u201d And no one heaping scorn on Bush seemed to consider that people typically react very differently when they get to try for themselves technology they have previously only passively experienced being handled by others, no matter how common it might be.  A stethoscope is hardly a cutting edge medical tool, for example, but how many times have we seen non-doctors react with amazement when they put one in their own ears for the first time and a listen to a live human heartbeart?   What it all came down to was that President Bush (whose popularity rating had been at a record high just a year earlier) became the scapegoat for an economic recession. Once the hoopla over the Persian Gulf War receded into the past and Americans once again turned their attention to more mundane matters (i.e., money), Bush\u2019s public image shifted from \u201cconquering hero\u201d to \u201cpolitician befuddled by economic matters.\u201d He had told us that a recession wouldn\u2019t happen, and now that it was here, all he had to say about it was that it would end soon.  Even if Bush had been in a grocery store or two since the advent of scanners, everybody knew he had \u201cpeople\u201d to do his shopping for him, and therefore it was easy to paint a picture of him as someone who no more knew how to handle the economy than he knew the price of a carton of milk or a loaf of bread. All that was needed was a hook to hang the picture on, and Bush\u2019s encounter with a scanner at the National Grocers\u2019 Convention provided it. "

    "claim": "A New Zealand Woman died in Pensacola in an attempt to take an \"alligator selfie.\"",
    "content": " In April 2017, what appeared to be the regional news outlet Florida Sun Post published an article claiming a tourist from New Zealand had perished in an attempt to take an \u201calligator selfie\u201d: A 26-year old woman from New Zealand on vacation in Pensacola has died in a tragic accident after she reportedly attempted to \u2018take a selfie with an alligator\u2019 on the Edward Ball nature trail. Witnesses at the scene claimed that they warned the woman that the alligator was moving behind her, but she was too slow to react before it struck, seizing her legs and dragging her into the lake. The incident occurred just off the nature trail close to the University of Western Florida. The area is known to be the home of several gators, although there have been few cases of anyone receiving serious injuries from gator attacks in the area. That said, approaching a wild gator to take a photo is definitely not recommended. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in Pensacola all my life,\u201d said one witness, who was walking her dogs along the trail, \u201cbut never have I seen anyone take such a big risk, and for so little.\u201d According to the witness, the New Zealand tourist, who is yet to be formally named, deviated from the trail despite being warned by several locals that the gator may attack. \u201cShe risked her life to take a photo with a gator? It\u2019s madness, why would you do a thing like that?\u201d Stuff.co.nz reported on 12 April 2017 that the story had been \u201cpicked up by a major Kiwi news outlet,\u201d but did not link to that version, likely because the story does not actually exist. We contacted the Pensacola Police Department, who told us they were unaware of such an attack. Major Andrew Hobbs from the Escambia County Sheriff\u2019s Department told us that no one had called them at any point, either: We have not been informed nor do we have any knowledge of anyone being attacked by an alligator while trying to take a selfie.  Although the item appears to be a legitimate news report from a local outlet, the site appears to be one of a growing number of \u201cregional fake news\u201d sites. Outfits such as the Baltimore Gazette, the Sacramento Dispatch, the Salt Lake City Guardian, and the Houston Dispatch pose as the digital versions of hyperlocal newspapers, in order to better dupe readers into believing they are legitimate outlets. The design of the grouping of sites tends to be similar, and their credible-sounding names often further the impression they are legitimate news sources. However, there is no truth to the alligator selfie claim and no legitimate outlet reported on what would have been an extremely high-profile tragedy. "

    "claim": "A teacher's ad hoc class assignment is kept and treasured by her students. ",
    "content": " This inspirational tale of the \u201cteacher who made a difference\u201d (and its unnecessary explanatory coda) can be found on hundreds of web sites all over the Internet and has been widely forwarded as a \u201cgood luck\u201d chain letter via e-mail. And why not? It epitomizes principles we fervently wish to believe: that a dedicated educator (and religion) can make a positive, lasting difference in one\u2019s life; and that the world would be a better place if we found it in our hearts to reach out to each other. (Just in case we missed the point, the didactic end paragraph states it explicitly.) Sister Helen Mrosla, a Franciscan nun, submitted \u201cAll the Good Things\u201d to Proteus, A Journal of Ideas in 1991. Her article also appeared in Reader\u2019s Digest that same year, was reprinted in the original Chicken Soup for the Soul book in 1993, and was offered yet again in 1996\u2019s Stories for the Heart. Sister Mrosla first met Mark Eklund in her third-grade classroom at St. Mary\u2019s School in Morris, Minnesota, in 1959, and she encountered him again in 1965 when she served as his junior high math teacher. In April 1971, Mark was sent to Vietnam and assigned to the 585th Transportation Company in Phu Bai where he worked in a truck parts depot, and he kept in touch with his family and friends (including Sister Mrosla) through letters. In August 1971, as she was returning from a vacation, Sister Mrosla learned of Mark\u2019s death from her parents. (Although he died in Vietnam, Mark Eklund was not killed in combat; he died in his sleep of a pulmonary and cerebral edema.) In 1999, Sister Mrosla talked to an Associated Press reporter about Mark Eklund: His letters to family painted a safe picture, describing his work as a clerk at a truck parts depot far from the shooting. But to friends, including Sister Mrosla, he revealed fears of dying and frustration over what he perceived as a fruitless war effort. He told his former teacher about lying in his bunk listening to a firefight one night. \u201cHe was scared to death from the shooting,\u201d Sister Mrosla said. \u201cHe\u2019d have nightmares about it. I remember telling him I was praying for him.\u201d She filled her letters with stories about her students and how much they were like his class. Mourners at Mark\u2019s funeral lined the block around the red-brick Assumption Church, second only to the town\u2019s grain elevator in height. They filed up the stairs, into the sanctuary and past the open black casket. Sister Mrosla was the last in line. [Mark\u2019s classmate Chuck] Lesmeister helped bear the casket, draped in a flag, to a hearse for the five-block ride to the cemetery, where a soldier played \u201cTaps.\u201d As it was lowered into the ground, a soldier approached Sister Mrosla. \u201cAre you Mark\u2019s math teacher?\u201d he asked. \u201cHe talked about you. You may want to talk to his parents about his personal effects.\u201d The Eklunds were waiting for the nun when she arrived at a reception at the Lesmeister family farmhouse. Standing in the sunny kitchen, James Eklund pulled out a wallet. \u201cWe want to show you something. They found this on Mark when he was killed. We thought you might recognize it,\u201d he said, gently taking out a worn piece of paper that had been refolded many times and taped together. A few of Mark\u2019s school friends who were gathered around also recognized the paper, and one by one they told her they still had theirs. Lesmeister preserved his in his wedding album. Marilyn Lohr kept hers in her diary. And like Mark, Jim Halbe had his with him in his wallet. Although Sister Mrosla indicated she was happy that the circulation of her article on the Internet had brought Mark\u2019s story to a global audience, she was less than pleased that it had been turned into a chain letter promising good luck to recipients who passed it on. \u201cIt cheapens it somehow,\u201d she said.
