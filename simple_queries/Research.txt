    "claim": "Did a Mexican researcher eliminate HPV in hundreds of women using photodynamic therapy?",
    "content": " Though it received comparatively little coverage in U.S. media outlets, a Mexican scientist\u2019s medical breakthrough in February 2019 was legitimate. Mexico\u2019s National Polytecnic Institute (IPN) announced on 3 February 2019 that a team led by Eva Ram\u00f3n Gallegos had developed a non-invasive treatment that eliminated the human papillomavirus in 29 women in Mexico City as well as in 420 women in the states of Oaxaca and Veracruz in past experiments. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the human papillomavirus, known as HPV for short, is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S., with about 79 million Americans currently infected with some form of the virus. Around 14 variants of HPV can lead to a patient\u2019s developing cervical cancer, and the CDC reported that almost 12,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with cervical cancer every year. Ram\u00f3n Gallegos\u2019 work, which she has carried out for 20 years, involves the use of photodynamic therapy, in which a drug (referred to as a \u201cphotosensitizer\u201d) is injected into the HPV patient\u2019s bloodstream. The patient is later exposed to light through the use of a laser, or fiber-optic cables. For example, as the National Cancer Institute reported: Approximately 24 to 72 hours after injection, when most of the agent has left normal cells but remains in cancer cells, the tumor is exposed to light. The photosensitizer in the tumor absorbs the light and produces an active form of oxygen that destroys nearby cancer cells \u2026 The photosensitizer can damage blood vessels in the tumor, thereby preventing the cancer from receiving necessary nutrients. [The therapy] also may activate the immune system to attack the tumor cells. In her work, Ram\u00f3n Gallegos and her team employed a substance called 5-Aminolevulinic acid, which over the course of four hours becomes the fluorescent compound Protoporphyrin IX. After the compound accumulates within infected cells, IPN reported, those cells were susceptible to being affected by her team\u2019s laser. IPN reported that the treatment also helped patients dealing with what are referred to as premalignant lesions associated with the early states of cervical cancer, and some 64.3 percent of patients suffering from HPV and lesions had the virus eradicated through Ram\u00f3n Gallegos\u2019 work. We contacted IPN seeking comment on what the next stage will be for Ram\u00f3n Gallegos after her latest findings but did not hear back prior to publication. "

    "claim": "The Susan G. Komen breast cancer organization gives only 20% of their donations to cancer research and pays their CEO $684,000 per year.",
    "content": "  When Susan Goodman Komen died of breast cancer at the age of 33 in 1980, her younger sister, Nancy Goodman Brinker promised she would do whatever she could to help end that disease.  Brinker fulfilled that promise by founding The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation (later known as Susan G. Komen for the Cure, then just Susan G. Komen) in 1982, a group that has since become the largest and most well known breast cancer organization in the United States:  Brinker fulfilled a promise to her sister that she would do everything she could to help eradicate the disease \u2014 a disease that Brinker also was diagnosed with and successfully fought. \u201cAt that time, there was a stigma and shame around breast cancer,\u201d Brinker said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t talk about it. There were no 800-numbers, no Internet. Our government didn\u2019t spend much on breast cancer research. There were few major cancer centers with expertise about breast cancer. That\u2019s the world we faced when Suzy was diagnosed. It\u2019s a world I watched her suffer in, and it\u2019s a world she wanted us to change.\u201d  In 2012, Komen founder and CEO Nancy Brinker became the focus of controversy when she announced Komen would be pulling the grants the organization had been providing to Planned Parenthood for breast cancer screenings, then quickly reversed that decision.  Several months later Brinker announced she would be stepping down as Komen\u2019s CEO, but the following year she was again the focus of controversy when news outlets reported that not only did she still hold her CEO position, but she had received a hefty raise to boot that brought her annual compensation up to $684,000 per year:  In early 2012, Komen announced it was pulling its grants for breast-cancer screenings from Planned Parenthood, drawing an immediate backlash from Komen supporters and abortion rights advocates. Within days, Nancy Brinker, the group\u2019s founder and CEO, reversed the decision to defund the organization. Then, in August, Brinker announced that she would be stepping down. But 10 months later, Brinker still holds her position and tax documents reveal that she received a 64 percent raise and now makes $684,000 a year, according to the charity\u2019s latest available tax filing.  Komen says the raise came in November 2010, prior to last year\u2019s controversy. Ken Berger, president and CEO of Charity Navigator, which evaluates and rates charities, called Brinker\u2019s salary \u201cextremely high.\u201d \u201cThis pay package is way outside the norm,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a quarter of a million dollars more than what we see for charities of this size. This is more than the head of the Red Cross is making, for an organization that is one-tenth the size of the Red Cross.\u201d  The American Red Cross had revenue of about $3.4 billion, while Komen\u2019s was about $340 million last year.  Red Cross CEO Gail McGovern makes $500,000, according to the most recent financial documents available for the charity.          Charity Navigator\u2019s last compensation figure for Nancy Brinker was $560,896 per year, which at the time put her below Komen president Elizabeth Thompson\u2019s reported annual compensation of $606,461.   In June 2013, Komen finally announced that Brinker would be stepping down as president and CEO of that organization and named Judith A. Salerno, M.D. as her successor.  In June 2015, Brinker reportedly resigned from her paid position to assume an unpaid role role as a top volunteer with Komen. Dr. Salerno\u2019s most recently reported compensation (in August 2017) was $479,858, while Nancy Brinker was still listed as a \u201cfounder\u201d receiving a salary of $397,093. In September 2017, Paula Schneider took over as president and CEO of Komen, with compensation of $137,155 reported as of the end of the fiscal year in March 2018. The reference to Komen\u2019s applying only 20% of donated money to breast cancer research likely comes from a pie chart displayed in the \u201cUse of Funds\u201d section of Wikipedia\u2019s article about Susan G. Komen for the Cure, which showed Komen\u2019s 2009-2010 Expenses:  While it may have been true that breast cancer research comprised only a 21% share of Komen\u2019s program expenses (Charity Navigator puts the figure at 28.8% as of March 2018), citing that figure as a criticism of the organization reflects a common misbelief that groups dedicated to addressing particular diseases (e.g., the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the ALS Association) exist solely or primarily to fund and direct research into curing and/or preventing those diseases.  This perception is inaccurate: Komen and other groups like it have goals that include delivering a wide array of services to the communities they support beyond the funding of research, such as funding educational awareness and outreach programs, providing screening and diagnostic procedures, and arranging medical treatment and home care for persons currently living with those diseases.  A more relevant metric for assessing a charity\u2019s overall financial effectiveness is the percentage of the organization\u2019s budget that is actually spent on all the programs and services the charity delivers, and in this area the Charity Navigator charity evaluation site gives  Komen an 80.3 rating (as well as a 96.0 rating for Accountability &amp; Transparency).  Charity Navigator does rank many other breast cancer charities higher than Susan G. Komen for the Cure, however. Regarding the seemingly excessively high level of CEO salaries at some charities, Charity Navigator advises that:  While there are certainly some charities that overpay their leaders, Charity Navigator\u2019s data shows that those organizations are the minority. Among the charities we\u2019ve evaluated (those being mid to large-sized charities), the typical CEO\u2019s annual compensation is in the low to mid six figures. Before you make any judgments about salaries higher or lower than that range, we encourage you to keep in mind that these charities are complex organizations, with multi-million dollar budgets, hundreds of employees, and thousands of constituents. These leaders could inevitably make much more running similarly sized for-profit firms. Furthermore, when making your decision it is important to consider that it takes a certain level of professionalism to effectively run a charity and charities must offer a competitive salary if they want to attract and retain that level of leadership.

Submit any questionable rumors and \u201cadvice\u201d you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.   In late June and early July 2020, Snopes readers asked whether Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s foremost immunologist, had stated that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was told to cancel funding for research into how coronavirus infections emerge in humans. Fauci, who leads the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made the statement when responding to a question while testifying, along with other coronavirus task force leaders, on June 23, 2020, before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The testimony came as the U.S. experienced a spike in reported COVID-19 cases. Although scientists believe that the novel coronavirus, the virus causing the COVID-19 disease pandemic, had animal origins before it infected humans, the Trump administration has promoted an unfounded conspiracy theory that the disease originated in a lab in Wuhan, China, where it was originally detected in the winter of 2019.         U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey asked Fauci about the grant, stating it didn\u2019t make any sense to him that funding for research on the coronavirus had been canceled \u201cwhile we are in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic,\u201d asking Fauci if he knew why the decision had been made. \u201cWhy was it canceled? It was canceled because the NIH was told to cancel it,\u201d Fauci replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know the reason, but we were told to cancel it.\u201d The exchange can be heard right after the 4:36 mark in this C-SPAN video. Fauci later clarified to Politico that it was the White House specifically that directed NIH to cut off the funding. Funding for the research project, which was run by the U.S. non-profit EcoHealth Alliance, was pulled on April 24. The move raised suspicion that it was done for political reasons, as the science and technology outlet Ars Technica reported: The funding cut could set back critical research into preventing such disease spread, scientists say. They also expressed dismay that the decision was prompted by unfounded conspiracy theories and what some see as a wider attempt by the Trump administration to deflect criticism of its handling of the pandemic by blaming China for unleashing the disease. The move was criticized by scientists, who called it counterproductive in the fight against the pandemic. Because Fauci stated in public testimony that NIH was told to cancel a grant for coronavirus research and later clarified to Politico that it was the White House that had initiated cutting a research grant for the EcoHealth Alliance research, we rate this claim \u201cCorrect Attribution.\u201d "

    "claim": "The Trump Administration\u2019s policies have halted a research effort seeking a cure for HIV.",
    "content": " In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that they would be canceling a contract with a company called Advanced Bioscience Resources Inc. (ABR) to procure fetal tissue for federal medical research projects. The department alleged that they were not \u201csufficiently assured that the contract included the appropriate protections applicable to fetal tissue research or met all other procurement requirements.\u201d Using this development as pretext, HHS announced that they would additionally be conducting \u201ca comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue to ensure consistency with statutes and regulations governing such research, and to ensure the adequacy of procedures and oversight of this research in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved\u201d \u2014 in effect putting a \u201cpause\u201d on all research that relied on fetal tissue. ABR supplied fetal tissue to two National Institutes of Health [NIH] laboratories, one of which uses the material to create what are known as humanized mice. In a broad sense, these mice have been bred, with the help of fetal human tissue, to express a human immune response, making them a cost-effective way to test the efficacy of immunotherapeutic drugs:  Such mice are particularly valuable for HIV drug testing in part because tissue from a single human fetus can readily generate a group of 40 to 50 genetically identical mice, and because the animals can, unlike monkeys, be infected with the human virus, HIV. Potential drugs can then be tested in such a group, with ample mice as controls, giving the studies robust statistical power.  ABR had been the supplier of fetal tissue to NIH\u2019s Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Montana, which had been using humanized mice to test potential HIV therapies. In a grant report on that laboratory\u2019s efforts to study HIV using humanized-mouse models during the 2016 fiscal year, NIH scientist Kim Hasenkrug indicated strong potential for their research methods to aid in the search for new treatments for HIV:  Experiments in FY2016 revealed that our \u2026 humanized mouse model can be used in long-term studies (up to one year) with [Antiretroviral Therapy, ART] administered by injections or via an oral route (drugs incorporated into mouse chow). Such mice develop chronic and latent HIV infections. We have demonstrated that HIV viral loads in these mice can be suppressed to levels undetectable by highly sensitive PCR tests for viremia and provirus.          Warner Greene, the director of the Gladstone Center for HIV Cure Research in San Francisco, had been collaborating with RML to test potential antibody therapies on humanized mice, and he first told Science that the HHS \u201cpause\u201d on fetal tissue procurement meant that the researchers could not guarantee enough mice to complete a statistically robust study. In a phone call, he explained to us that:  What happened in September was that my NIH collaborator at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories [Kim Hasenkrug] was informed that he could no longer order fetal tissue from the sole source supplier, ABR, and so we [were told that we] could complete the [initial] experiment that [had already been set up], but in science you need to do multiple experiments. You can\u2019t depend upon one experiment to see whether it\u2019s repeatable, etc. So essentially this ban on fetal tissue stopped the line of investigation.  Speaking to Science, Greene said that \u201cHasenkrug had not yet launched the experiment, and [RML\u2019s] supplies of existing mice were too small to conduct the repeated experiments required to reach convincing scientific conclusions.\u201d In a 9 December 2018 statement provided to Science after the publication\u2019s original 7 December 2018 reporting, HHS acknowledged that they had (at least temporarily) blocked staff scientists from procuring fetal tissue, but that they did not think \u2014 or realize \u2014 such a move would have affected the study in question:  [In their statement, the NIH] said the agency in September \u201cput a pause in place\u201d for staff scientists procuring new human fetal tissue, \u201can action NIH thought was prudent given the examination of these procurements. Research with tissue already on hand could proceed, and NIH leaders asked to be notified by intramural investigators if new procurement would be necessary. NIH leadership was not informed that new procurement was necessary for the study you reference in your [7 December 2018 Science story]. We are looking into why this did not occur.\u201d  In his interview with us, Greene stated that this explanation made no sense. \u201cTo my knowledge \u2026 we were never made aware that we should approach the NIH to inform them of our need for more fetal tissue to complete this investigation.\u201d If such a request were required, Greene said, he and his team would have \u201cacted upon it in a millisecond.\u201d We also reached out to the director of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which oversees the Rocky Mountain Laboratory) for an update on the current status of the project and for clarification on the fetal tissue review\u2019s impact on the study but have not received a response. However, as HHS has acknowledged both that they \u201cput a pause in place\u201d on fetal tissue procurement, and that this pause resulted in the inability of a trial seeking an HIV cure to move forward, it is factual to state that the Trump administration\u2019s policies shut down (at least temporarily) scientists\u2019 efforts to find a cure for HIV. Greene told us that NIH has been extremely supportive of their work, and that he feels that this change is \u201cclearly a policy that\u2019s \u2026 reflective of a new political situation in Washington, D.C., that\u2019s now impacting our science.\u201d Greene is one of many who viewed the 24 September announcement regarding fetal tissue research as a proxy debate over abortion. Chronologically, the announcement that the federal government would cut ties with ABR followed a campaign by several anti-abortion groups who explicitly sought to have the government cancel its contract with ABR, as reported in Science:  On 11 September, 45 anti-abortion groups wrote to HHS Secretary Alex Azar that they were \u201cshocked and dismayed\u201d by the FDA contract [with ABR]. On 17 September, 85 members of Congress wrote a similar letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb asking him to cancel the contract. Reacting to HHS\u2019s actions [on 24 September], Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said: \u201cMy instinct is that this is driven by politics, and is part of the overall effort to stigmatize and eventually criminalize abortion, as well as part of a larger campaign to roll back the clock on sexual and reproductive rights.\u201d  Greene told us that after much internal debate, he and Hasenkrug plan on running that initial experiment anyway, with the hopes that the political climate will change in their favor come January 2019.

    "claim": "New research suggests that Marmite helps combat premature ejaculation.",
    "content": " In the September 2016 issue of the journal Andrologica, a team of researchers published a study that concluded:  [V]itamin B12 concentrations in the blood were significantly lower in patients with PE than the subjects without PE (p &lt; .0001)\u2026. Moreover, the vitamin B12 levels correlated positively with [intravaginal ejaculation latency time] IELT values and correlated negatively with [premature ejaculation diagnostic tool] PEDT scores. This work has also demonstrated that plasma vitamin B12 levels in patients with PE showed an increasing trend with decreasing PE severity.  On October 7, 2016, The Daily Mail inexplicably decided to use this study to advance a pro-Marmite agenda:  [S]ales of Marmite may be in for a boost after scientists discovered it could hold the secret to making men last longer in the bedroom. New research suggests a diet rich in daily helpings of vitamin B12 can combat premature ejaculation, a problem which affects one in four men in the UK. And Marmite is one of the richest sources of the vitamin \u2013 along with meat, fish, eggs and fortified breakfast cereals.  The connection they made sounds \u2014 and may be \u2014 reasonable, but it relies on the untested assumption that increasing B12 would reduce premature ejaculation. Correlation, after all, does not necessarily equal causation, as the authors of the study state:  It is not yet known whether this finding could be translated into a solution for PE; however, vitamin B12 supplementation for the treatment of PE merits further evaluation.  The Daily Mail claim also relies on the assumption that all PE is caused by the same factor, a notion that is not supported by current research:  The pathophysiology of premature ejaculation appears to be multifactorial, implicating the need for multimodal therapeutic regimens to successfully treat premature ejaculation. Multiple treatment regimens have been shown to be effective in extending the time between penetration and ejaculation.  Still, Marmite is fortified with vitamin B12, and it contains 25% of the recommended daily intake of the vitamin. Meat, however, is a much more plentiful source of B12. Because Marmite is completely vegetarian, however, it is a good option for those who do not eat meat. If you want to get your B12 from a source that is not Marmite or meat, have no fear! Many breakfast cereals are fortified with 25% of your daily intake of the vitamin, too. "

    "content": " On 17 December 2016, President-elect Donald Trump nominated South Carolina representative Mick Mulvaney to lead the Office of Management and Budget. From the transition team statement:  \u201cWe are going to do great things for the American people with Mick Mulvaney leading the Office of Management and Budget,\u201d said President-elect Trump. \u201cRight now we are nearly $20 trillion in debt, but Mick is a very high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nation\u2019s finances and save our country from drowning in red ink. With Mick at the head of OMB, my administration is going to make smart choices about America\u2019s budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer\u2019s trust in how their money is spent.\u201d  He has been characterized by many as a \u201cdeficit hawk\u201d and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-line fiscal conservatives. As director of the OMB, he would run an organization that, in its words:  Assists the President in overseeing the preparation of the Federal budget and in supervising its administration in Federal agencies [and] also oversees and coordinates the Administration\u2019s procurement, financial management, information, and regulatory policies.          On 19 December 2016, Mother Jones\u2019 Pema Levy reported on one of Mulvaney\u2019s since-deleted Facebook posts, unearthed by a Democratic opposition research group named American Bridge. This post from 9 September 2016 came at a time that Congress was debating funding research into efforts to fight the spread of the Zika virus. In it, Mulvaney suggested the federal government (whose budget office he is now nominated to lead) might not be well served by funding science research at all:  It has been a busy week, and with everything else going on I haven\u2019t had a chance to post on Zika, which I know has been in the news a bit. I have received all sorts of emails and FB comments this week on Zika. Some people want me to pass a \u201cclean\u201d bill (which I suppose means not paying for it with spending reductions elsewhere). Other folks want us to fund more research if we can find a way to pay for it. No one has written me yet, though, to ask what might be the best question: do we really need government-funded research at all.  The post, though deleted, can still be viewed on a cached version of Mulvaney\u2019s Facebook page. His argument against science funding (and science in general) seems to follow arguments made by other prominent Trump transition team figures: because science is sometimes wrong, or not clear cut, it shouldn\u2019t be trusted. In defense of his opposition to funding Zika research, the remainder of this 9 September 2016 post cited a recent study that cast doubt on the viruses connection to infant microcephaly:  And before you inundate me with pictures of children with birth defects, consider this: Brazil\u2019s microcephaly epidemic continues to pose a mystery \u2014 if Zika is the culprit, why are there no similar epidemics in other countries also hit hard by the virus? In Brazil, the microcephaly rate soared with more than 1,500 confirmed cases. But in Colombia, a recent study of nearly 12,000 pregnant women infected with Zika found zero microcephaly cases. If Zika is to blame for microcephaly, where are the missing cases? Perhaps there is another reason for the epidemic in Brazil. According to a new report by the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI), the number of missing cases in Colombia and elsewhere raises serious questions about the assumed connection between Zika and microcephaly. That isn\u2019t from some politicians website or some right-wing advocacy group.  The information to which Mulvaney is referring comes from a press release provided by the New England Complex Systems Institute, and posted on the science news aggregator ScienceDaily.com on 24 June 2016. The findings that Mulvaney cites to are summarized in that release:  In Brazil, the microcephaly rate soared with more than 1,500 confirmed cases. But in Colombia, a recent study of nearly 12,000 pregnant women infected with Zika found zero microcephaly cases. If Zika is to blame for microcephaly, where are the missing cases?  In the final portion of Mulvaney\u2019s post, he incorrectly asserts that this scientific information came from the New England Journal of Medicine because the press release cited a study from that journal. The NEJM study cited in the release \u2014 a review of data from Brazil\u2019s Zika epidemic \u2014 concluded the exact opposite:  On the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies.  And, as it turns out, so did the New England Complex Systems Institute. A closer look at the actual reports reveals that the NECSI had been releasing semi-monthly reports on Zika in Colombia since May 2016. Early on, they found no evidence to support a connection between the virus and microcephaly. Later data, however, revealed that more time was needed to see the effects of the virus in children born to Zika infected mothers. In their August report (the final one in this series), they stated:  The epidemic of Zika in Colombia was expected to result in many cases of microcephaly. However, until epidemiological week 23 (June 11) there were only 6 reported cases. The number of cases increased to 21 in weeks 24-27, which appears to confirm expectations about Zika as a cause of microcephaly [\u2026]  Mulvaney has not commented on his reason for deleting the post.

    "claim": "New research has uncovered that the true cause of fibromyalgia is an excess number of specific nerves found near a specific kind of blood vessel in the hands and feet, ending the controversy over the disease\u2019s cause and mechanism.",
    "content": " Since at least June 2013, a nearly identical article has appeared on a number of websites with the headline \u201cFibromyalgia Mystery Finally Solved!\u201d These stories, which continue to appear online, begin with the same claim:  Researchers have found the main source of pain in Fibromyalgia patients, and contrary to what many believe, it does not stem from the brain. The findings mark the end of a decades-old mystery about the disease, which many doctors believed was conjured in patients\u2019 imaginations. [\u2026] Up until recently, many physicians thought that the disease was \u201cimaginary\u201d or psychological, but scientists have now revealed that the main source of pain stems from a most unlikely place \u2014 excess blood vessels in the hand, legs and foot.  Fibromyalgia is is an enigmatic condition that disproportionately affects women; it is associated with clinically unexplained pain, potentially combined with other symptoms of unknown medical origin. As reported in a 2014 review paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association:  Fibromyalgia may be considered as a discrete diagnosis or as a constellation of symptoms characterized by central nervous system pain amplification with concomitant fatigue, memory problems, and sleep and mood disturbances.  Before diving into the research claims made in this \u201cfibromyalgia solved\u201d brand of clickbait, it is important to mention that framing the issue as a debate between those who think the pain is \u201cimaginary\u201d and those who think it is \u201creal\u201d is an extremely reductive description of the medical hypotheses surrounding fibromyalgia, and, indeed, of pain itself.         The most common explanation for the symptoms that present as fibromyalgia in the scientific literature is a phenomenon dubbed \u201ccentral sensitization\u201d, in which the central nervous system (either through physical trauma or another cause) lowers its threshold for registering external signals as pain. As described in a 2009 review:  Instead [of being caused by an external factor], central sensitization represents an abnormal state of responsiveness or increased gain of the nociceptive system [the part of the sensory nervous system that sends pain signals]. The pain is effectively generated as a consequence of changes within the [central nervous system] that then alter how it responds to sensory inputs, rather than reflecting the presence of [a physical source of pain].  While central sensitization may not have an external source, the pain is no more \u201creal\u201d or \u201cimaginary\u201d than any other pain caused by an actual physical stimulus. The study referenced in the viral stories, published in 2013 in the journal Pain Medicine, makes an argument for a physical, detectable source of the condition. The study focused on a specific kind of blood vessel in the hand \u2014 arteriole venule shunts \u2014 that can direct blood flow to bypass the hands in response to temperature, as described in a 2013 press release from the University of Albany, where the research was conducted:  In humans, these types of shunts are unique to the palms of our hands and soles of our feet which work like the radiator in a car. Under warm conditions, the shunts close down to force blood into the capillaries at the surface of the skin in order to radiate heat from the body, and our hands get sweaty. Under cold conditions, the shunts open wide allowing blood to bypass the capillaries in order to conserve heat, and our hands get cold and put on gloves.  The researchers, who were also associated with a biotech company (INTiDYN) that developed the imaging technique used in the study, analyzed biopsies from 24 female patients with fibromyalgia and compared them to a number of healthy control subjects. The authors found that there was a significant excess number of nerves around these shunts in the fibromyalgia patient\u2019s hands. The senior author on the paper, Frank Rice, explained the potential significance of the findings in their press release:  \u201cInstead of being in the brain, the pathology consists of excessive sensory nerve fibers around specialized blood vessel structures located in the palms of the hands,\u201d said Dr. Rice, President of Intidyn and the senior researcher on the study. \u201cThis discovery provides concrete evidence of a fibromyalgia-specific pathology which can now be used for diagnosing the disease, and as a novel starting point for developing more effective therapeutics.\u201d  Outside of providing an explanation for fibromyalgia pain, the authors suggest this mechanism could also relate to other symptoms commonly associated with the condition:  In human and nonhuman primates, the [hair-free skin found on the hands and feet] plays a major role in thermoregulation and the maintenance of core body temperature as well as the apportionment of blood to other organs such as skeletal muscle during periods of high metabolic demand. Therefore, [an excess of nerves near arteriole venule shunts in the hair free skin on the hands of fibromyalgia] patients may contribute to extreme tenderness and pain in the hands, but may also contribute to the chronic widespread deep pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction associated with [fibromyalgia].  While the study is real, it was limited in its scope due to its low sample size. Further, it does not appear to have shifted the debate away from hypotheses that revolve primarily around central sensitization, despite claims that the mystery had been \u201csolved\u201d. A 2015 review on the condition released by the Mayo Clinic describes the state of the field:  Earlier there was some doubt about whether there was an \u201corganic basis\u201d for these related conditions, but today there is irrefutable evidence from brain imaging and other techniques that this condition has strong biological underpinnings, even though psychological, social, and behavioral factors clearly play prominent roles in some patients. The pathophysiological hallmark is a sensitized or hyperactive central nervous system that leads to an increased volume control or gain on pain and sensory processing.  While the study is real and their specific results are not in question, it was neither new as of 2017, nor did it substantively change the debate on the cause of fibromyalgia, much less \u201csolve the mystery\u201d. As such, we rank the claim as mostly false. "

    "claim": "New research from Arizona State University suggests that a catastrophic super-eruption from the Yellowstone caldera could occur sooner than previously thought.",
    "content": " On 10 October 2017, the New York Times ran a story (with the ominous headline \u201cA Surprise From the Supervolcano Under Yellowstone\u201d) that reported on an August 2017 presentation made by Arizona State University PhD candidate Hannah Shamloo at the 2017 \u201cInternational Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth\u2019s Interior\u201d conference. Christy Till, a professor at Arizona State University\u2019s School of Earth and Space Exploration, is the lead researcher of the lab responsible for the work, and was a co-author on the presentation, as well. The Times article discussed their findings, which suggested \u2014 in broad brushstrokes \u2014 that chemical changes that occurred  prior to the past Yellowstone supereruption happened not on a timescale of millennia, as previously believed, but potentially within mere decades. The Times described the crux of the findings this way:  Scientists are just now starting to realize that the conditions that lead to supereruptions might emerge within a human lifetime.  A number of other outlets picked up this story, likely in part because Yellowstone supereruption content is a treasure trove of guaranteed clicks. These stories, as is so often the case, came with increasing levels of inaccuracy, as increasingly sensationalized claims bounced through the Internet echo chamber. By 12 October 2017, the story (as reported by USA Today) had become:  Yellowstone supervolcano may blow sooner than thought \u2014 and could wipe out life on the planet.          To be clear, this is in no way what the researchers at Arizona State University (or anyone else in the field of volcanology) were arguing. First, and most importantly, their research does not in any way, shape, or form, change predictions about the likelihood of a supereruption happening within our lifetimes. That risk remains exceedingly low. Till told us in a telephone interview that her work involves high-resolution chemical sampling of layers in crystals found trapped in rocks (a practice similar to reading past climate information from tree rings). These methods are designed to uncover the nature and timing of chemical changes occurring in magma chambers prior to eruptions. In the case of this specific conference presentation, the topic was the most recent supereruption from the Yellowstone caldera, which occurred 631,000 years ago. Their analysis, achieved by sampling crystals at a resolution of \u201cone-one-hundredth the thickness of a human hair,\u201d suggests that clear and dramatic changes may have occurred in the magma chamber, geologically speaking, shortly before the catastrophic eruption:  Our research is all about the idea that we do see signals in crystals from Yellowstone\u2019s last big eruption 631,000 ago [that could indicate] that there were injections of hotter magma that might have mobilized [cooler magma already in the chamber].  These \u201cinjections\u201d, Till told us, could have occurred just decades before the eruption \u2014 a considerably shorter period of time than some previous ideas about how such processes would work. As such, the research could provide insight into volcanological processes and mechanisms that precede Yellowstone eruptions. This, however, stressed Till, \u201cdoes nothing to suggest that there\u2019s going to be a future eruption.\u201d Further, the chemical signals described in the August presentation are not exclusively indicative of wildly destructive and explosive supereruptions, either. In fact, Till published a paper in 2015 demonstrating similar chemical changes prior to more recent but non-explosive lava flows in Yellowstone.  Ilya Bindeman, a professor of volcanology at the University of Oregon unassociated with the ASU team, echoed this point, telling us via e-mail:  Most eruptions at Yellowstone are lava flows [\u2026], they discharge [a] similar or comparable amount of magma without a super eruption. Since 630,000 years ago there have been many [\u2026] such eruptions. These eruptive products also have \u201cshort\u201d diffusion profiles [similar to the ones from the explosive 630,000 year old event] in their crystals, but they erupted quietly.         While media outlets frequently raise the specter of an apocalyptic supereruption from the Yellowstone caldera, and while the region has indeed produced massive Earth-altering events in the past, scientists remain convinced, based on the size and shape of the current magma chamber, that such an eruption \u2014 were it to happen again \u2014 would likely not occur in our lifetimes. The USGS considers the risk of a caldera-forming apocalypse at Yellowstone in the next couple of thousand years \u201cexceedingly low\u201d. Reassuringly, the Yellowstone region is constantly monitored for potential signs of trouble, as well. The Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, a collaboration between between the University of Utah, the United States Geological Survey, and the National Park Service, monitors real-time seismic activity, land deformation (from GPS and satellite measurements), and thermal changes or chemical signals from the gases being released (from surface detectors). This kind of predictive work was not the purpose of Till and Shamloo\u2019s research. Their work hopes to uncover a deeper mechanistic understanding of Yellowstone eruptions:  What we\u2019re trying to do is understand that if we do see a signal, what are some other properties that might be causing it to kick in bigger? And what is the timescale associated between that happening in each eruption here? [\u2026] We already have very good scientists who monitor the volcano and would be able to give you [\u2026] months to years warning of an eruption. That\u2019s not changing in any way and there\u2019s no reason that it was going to happen there.  Till, when we asked if media reports of this conference talk were sensationalized, answered with a categorical and immediate \u201cyes.\u201d Because the nature of Till and Shamloo\u2019s work does not intend to assess the probability of a massive supereruption (nor is it capable of doing so), we rank the claim that this new research suggests an increased risk of a humanity-ending death-blast from Yellowstone in our lifetimes as false.

    "claim": "A new tattoo ink changes color depending on a person's glucose levels, meaning people with diabetes can use it to check their blood sugar levels.",
    "content": " On 9 June 2017, the Dose Facebook page posted a meme claiming that a new kind of tattoo ink changes color based on blood sugar levels, providing a warning system for people with diabetes: This tattoo ink changes color when blood sugar levels rise or fall, so people with diabetes can monitor in real time.  The post had been shared more than 300,000 times as of 28 June 2017, and we have received several inquiries about its veracity.  It is, indeed, based on real research that students, postdoctoral fellows, and professors are undertaking at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard Medical School.  The DermalAbyss project has not yet been tested on human skin, and is at the \u201cproof of concept stage,\u201d according to a May 2017 report by the MIT Media Lab.  Traditional tattoo inks are replaced with biosensors whose colors change in response to variations in the interstitial fluid. It blends advances in biotechnology with traditional methods in tattoo artistry.          Interstitial fluid is a layer of fluid that surrounds cells within the body. Measuring the level of glucose (blood sugar) in the fluid is an important way for people with diabetes to keep their blood sugar at an appropriate level and avoid diabetic shock (severe hypoglycemia).  The ink changes color based on three different biochemical measures in the interstitial fluid: the pH level (acidity) changes the ink from pink to purple; the glucose level changes it from blue to brown; and the sodium and pH levels cause the ink light up at a higher intensity under ultraviolet light.  DermalAbyss: Possibilities of Biosensors as a Tattooed Interface from Fluid Interfaces on Vimeo. The MIT researchers are Katia Vega, Xin Liu, Viirj Kan and Nick Barry; those at Harvard include Ali Yetisen and Nan Jiang.         They theorize that the biosensors could eventually replace the current method commonly used by people with diabetes to test their glucose levels, which involves pricking the skin.  With DermalAbyss, we imagine the future where the painful procedure is replaced with a tattoo, of which the color [changes] from pink to purple based on the glucose levels. Thus, the user could monitor the color changes and the need of insulin. However, the tattoo ink has so far only been tested on the skin of a dead pig, and the researchers say \u201cthere are currently no plans to develop DermalAbyss as a product or to pursue clinical trials.\u201d So it\u2019s a little bit of a stretch to claim, as the Dose meme did, that the ink means \u201cpeople with diabetes can monitor [their blood sugar] in real time.\u201d This is the theory, and the project looks promising so far. But it\u2019s not yet at the stage where it can actually be used by people with diabetes.  "

    "claim": "Bee sting venom can kill HIV.",
    "content": " A recurring scientific item spread online since 2013 has presented variations of the claim that bee sting venom can kill HIV, the disease that often leads to AIDS. This assertion is rooted in a 2013 study published in the journal Antiviral Therapy. As stated in that paper, the goal of the research was to establish a proof-of-concept for a topical anti-HIV gel using melittin, a peptide found in bee venom, that could serve as a prophylactic against HIV when applied prior to sexual activity. That melittin is damaging to viruses is not the breakthrough aspect of this research. Melittin is a cytolytic, which essentially means it can destroy cells by increasing their permeability. The problem is that melittin has this effect not just on viruses, but also on important human cells: Bee venom contains a potent toxin called melittin that can poke holes in the protective envelope that surrounds HIV, and other viruses. Large amounts of free melittin can cause a lot of damage. Indeed, in addition to antiviral therapy, the paper\u2019s senior author, [\u2026] has shown melittin-loaded nanoparticles to be effective in killing tumor cells. The breakthrough in this study was the researchers\u2019 ability to attach melittin to complex nanoparticles that allowed the compound to selectively target HIV without coming into contact with non-viral cells: The new study shows that melittin loaded onto these nanoparticles does not harm normal cells. That\u2019s because [the researchers] added protective bumpers to the nanoparticle surface. When the nanoparticles come into contact with normal cells, which are much larger in size, the particles simply bounce off. HIV, on the other hand, is even smaller than the nanoparticle, so HIV fits between the bumpers and makes contact with the surface of the nanoparticle, where the bee toxin awaits. Their results were promising, too. Melittin that was not attached to these bumper-modified nanoparticles inhibited the HIV virus\u2019s ability to infect cells, but it was also toxic to normal vaginal cells. But, according to the study, that latter effect was successfully blunted: Melittin formulated as a nanoparticle appears completely unreactive against vaginal epithelial or reporter cells in vitro, and still prevents infection \u2026 This meant that by proof of concept standards, the research team had succeeded. Later research achieved another goal: demonstrating that the gel was not toxic to sperm, either. That mileston would be a step forward for mixed HIV status couples interested in a natural conception, the authors of that study argued. But ultimately, the truth is that while this compound is a component of bee venom, the delivery of that compound is a specifically engineered nanoscale process. It should also be noted that these studies didn\u2019t even use melittin from an actual bee, but instead used a synthetic version \u2014 so being stung by live bees will in no way afford one protection against HIV.
