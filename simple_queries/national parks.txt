    "claim": "President Trump opened National Parks and wildlife refugees to coal mining.",
    "content": " In March 2017, multiple web sites published articles under headlines, such as \u201cTrump Opens National Parks and Wildlife Refuges for Coal Mining,\u201d which were true in a literal sense, but didn\u2019t convey that public lands had not been fully and permanently closed to such activity in the first place. On 28 March 2017, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled \u201cPresidential Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth\u201d that overturned several environmental regulations implemented during the Obama administration, such as a temporary (three-year) moratorium on the leasing of federal lands for coal mining: Federal Land Coal Leasing Moratorium.  The Secretary of the Interior shall take all steps necessary and appropriate to amend or withdraw Secretary\u2019s Order 3338 dated January 15, 2016 (Discretionary Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to Modernize the Federal Coal Program), and to lift any and all moratoria on Federal land coal leasing activities related to Order 3338.  The Secretary shall commence Federal coal leasing activities consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.  The Obama administration placed a three-year moratorium on the leasing of federal lands for coal mining in January 2016 in order to review how domestic coal production aligned with the United State\u2019s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This moratorium did not, however, completely halt coal production on public lands \u2014 Secretary\u2019s Order 3338 temporarily stopped new coal mining efforts from starting up on public lands but but allowed existing coal mining projects to continue in operation: The Obama administration will halt new coal mining on public land for the next three years with immediate effect as it undertakes a review of the \u201cenvironmental and public health impacts\u201d of coal production. The wide-ranging review, applauded by climate and environmental groups, will assess how federal coal production fits in with the US\u2019s commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. It will also ensure \u201cAmerican taxpayers are earning a fair return for the use of their public resources\u201d \u2014 raising the possibility of a hike in royalties or a new levy on coal producers. About 40% of US coal is mined on public land. Barack Obama flagged new restrictions on coal exploitation in his State of the Union address, saying: \u201cI\u2019m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.\u201d The department of interior, which oversees leases on public land, stressed that coal would continue to be an important part of the US\u2019s energy mix and that current operations would not be affected by the freeze in new leases. It is estimated there is around 20 years-worth of coal production already under way, with 50 pending leases set to be affected by the decision. \u201cThe federal coal program is in needs of modernization, as we haven\u2019t down a top-down review for the past 30 years,\u201d said Sally Jewell, secretary of the department of interior. \u201cThe lease program was designed to get as much coal out of the ground as possible. It\u2019s time to take a careful look to see if it best serves the needs and priorities of today.\u201d Although President Trump\u2019s executive order lifted this moratorium a few years earlier then originally intended, it did not \u201copen\u201d public lands to coal mining, as such activity had already taken place and was still underway. The order did, however, allow for federal lands to be leased to coal companies for new mining operations that were precluded while the moratorium was in effect: Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has ended the federal government\u2019s Obama-era moratorium on coal-mining leases on federal land. Zinke signed an order repealing the pause in leases in his Washington, D.C., office, surrounded by Republican lawmakers, lobbyists and staffers. The action implements parts of an executive order that President Trump signed \u2014  focused on repealing environmental policies and restrictions on energy production \u2014 under the goal of increasing energy independence. That means the Bureau of Land Management can now resume the process of allowing new coal-mining leases on its land. So yes, President Trump signed an executive order that allowed for the issuance of new coal mining leases for federal lands.  But existing coal mining operations on federal lands were still ongoing, and the moratorium that precluded the issuance of new coal mining leases was due to expire in 2019. "

    "claim": "Law professor Alice Ristroph wrote in the Atlantic magazine that the 2017 solar eclipse, its path, or those who viewed it, were \"racist.\"",
    "content": " In August 2017, two right-wing web sites falsely reported that a law professor had written that a 2017 solar eclipse was \u201cracist.\u201d First, the Daily Caller published an article headlined \u201cThe Eclipse Is Racist Because It Fails to Affect Enough Black People, the Atlantic Suggests,\u201d stating that \u201cThe Atlantic, a once-great magazine, has determined that the total eclipse of the sun due to occur on Monday will fail to affect enough black people.\u201d The following day, the Conservative Tribune asserted in a similar vein: \u201cAre you looking forward to Monday\u2019s solar eclipse \u2014 the first full eclipse to hit the United States in decades? You filthy, filthy racist. That\u2019s at least the take of Brooklyn Law School professor Alice Ristroph, who used a staggering 4,544 words in The Atlantic to explaining why the phenomenon of the moon blocking the sun just wasn\u2019t diverse enough for her tastes.\u201d Both web sites were referring to an essay by Alice Ristroph, a professor at Brooklyn Law School in New York. Her essay, originally published in Democracy under the title \u201cBlackout,\u201d and republished by the Atlantic on 18 August 2017, did not state \u2014 or even imply \u2014 that the eclipse itself or the path of its totality were \u201cracist.\u201d Nor did Ristroph say or imply that the eclipse would not be visible to \u201cenough\u201d black people, or that those who chose to view the eclipse were \u201cracists.\u201d Instead, Ristroph penned a lyric essay that used the path of the eclipse as a literary mechanism to explore the United States\u2019 troubled racial history of \u201ctotality\u201d and \u201cdivision.\u201d In noting that the path of the eclipse would cross sections of the United States in which there lived \u201calmost no black people,\u201d Ristroph was clear to state that this circumstance was a coincidence (from an astronomical standpoint) but used that fact as an opportunity to examine the historical reasons why some areas of America remain predominantly non-black. Along the way, she discussed different visions of \u201ctotality,\u201d such as Oregon\u2019s original goal of being an all-white state, and General William Tecumseh Sherman\u2019s vision of \u201ctotal war\u201d during the U.S. Civil War.         At no point did Ristroph use the word \u201cracist,\u201d and she explicitly made the (blindingly obvious) point that the eclipse itself did not harbor any racial prejudice:  It has been dubbed the Great American Eclipse, and along most of its path, there live almost no black people. Presumably, this is not explained by the implicit bias of the solar system. It is a matter of population density, and more specifically geographic variations in population density by race, for which the sun and the moon cannot be held responsible \u2026 The shadow of the moon doesn\u2019t care where it falls or who lives below.  In 2015, the Daily Caller similarly prevaricated about a New York Times opinion piece on the subject of low visitation rates at national parks by minorities.  Under the headline \u201cNow America\u2019s National Parks Are Racist,\u201d the Daily Caller wrote:  The cozily white opinion pages of The New York Times attacked the National Park Service and America\u2019s majestic national parks as racist because way too many white people visit them. Also, the visitors are old. And about 80 percent of the park service\u2019s employees are white. Thus, \u201cminorities are unwelcome.\u201d  One again, the Daily Caller completely misrepresented the thrust of a race-related discussion.  The New York Times article in question, by Glenn Nelson, did not decry either America\u2019s national parks or the National Park Service as being \u201cracist,\u201d nor did that word appear anywhere in Nelson\u2019s piece.   The gist of Nelson\u2019s article was that attendance at U.S. national parks by minorities was comparatively low, that a primary reason for that phenomenon was unfamiliarity with national parks among minorities, and that the National Park Service should try to encourage broader visitation through outreach aimed at clearing up such unfamiliarity. Nelson did not assert, as the Daily Caller misrepresented, that \u201cminorities are unwelcome\u201d at U.S. national parks.  In fact, he argued the opposite \u2014 that the National Park Service should attempt to dispel the misperception among minorities that they were not welcome at national parks:  [M]any minorities say they know little about the nation\u2019s parks or what to expect when visiting them. In the 2011 park service survey, nonwhites were more than three times as likely as whites to say that the parks provided poor service and were not safe to visit. And those responses were from nonvisitors, which means that perceptions had congealed into reality among what should be an important constituency for the parks. We need to demolish the notion that the national parks and the rest of nature are an exclusive club where minorities are unwelcome. The park service[\u2018s] \u2026 outreach should be tailored to minorities and delivered where they log in, follow, Tweet, view or listen. The park service needs to shout to minorities from its iconic mountaintops, \u201cWe want you here!\u201d  On 12 January 2017, President Barack Obama took up that suggestion, issuing a memorandum on \u201cDiversity and Inclusion in Our National Parks\u201d that directed federal agencies (among other actions) to engage in conducting \u201cactive outreach to diverse populations\u201d and \u201cidentifying and making improvements to existing programs to increase visitation and access by diverse populations\u201d \u2014 \u201cparticularly minority, low-income, and disabled populations and tribal communities.\u201d "

    "claim": "Photographs show a road traffic warning sign that reads: \"Do Not Let Moose Lick Your Car.\"",
    "content": " On Nov. 14, 2020, a set of photographs supposedly showing a traffic sign in Canada warning passersby to \u201cnot let moose lick your car\u201d went viral on social media: These pictures stirred up some questions. Are these signs real? How exactly do you stop a moose from doing what a moose wants to do? And, just how widespread is the moose-licking-car problem in Canada? First of all, these pictures are real. This sign was spotted along Maligne Lake Road in Jasper, Alberta, Canada. And while the sign may seem a bit humorous, it addresses a genuine problem in the National Parks of Canada.  Moose, apparently, are somewhat obsessed with salt. Jue Urie, the owner-operator of the Jasper Tour Company, told the CBC:  \u201cRoad salt is kind of like crack [to moose].\u201d In the winter when roads are salted to prevent them from freezing, moose have figured out that the salt can be easily accessed on the front bumpers of parked cars. So when people stop to look at a moose, or when cars are simply parked in the area, these large animals can get dangerously close to the vehicles in order to get a taste of salt.          Fitzhugh.ca, a news website serving the Jasper area, talked to Jasper National Park spokesman Steve Young about the issue. Young said:  \u201c(This) started as an occasional issue a few years ago and now is too common \u2026 People are getting far too close, and it\u2019s perpetuated by their (the moose\u2019s) obsession with salt, accessing the vehicles.\u201d Here\u2019s a video news report from 2016 about moose licking cars in Alberta, Canada:      In 2016, during a similar spate of salt-licking moose incidents, Alberta Parks issued a warning to visitors to not let moose lick their cars. That warning had some specific strategies to deter this practice, such as honking the car horn, as well as some techniques to avoid, such as \u201cdo not attempt to push the moose away from your vehicle.\u201d This, of course, is not a problem specific to Canada. In 2018, the Buckrail, a news outlet from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, reported that U.S. National Parks officials were issuing similar warnings to visitors. Denise Germann, parks spokesperson, said: \u201cWe highly discourage the practice of allowing wildlife like moose to lick salt off vehicles.\u201d "

    "claim": "Some visitors to Joshua Tree National Park cut down trees and perpetrated other acts of vandalism in January 2019 while staff, whose numbers were diminished due to the federal government shutdown, attempted to monitor visitor behavior. ",
    "content": " The U.S. federal government shutdown, which entered its 21st day on 11 January 2019, had a significant negative impact on one institution of American life in particular: the national parks. With staff cut back to a minimum, monuments, forests, and wilderness areas around the country saw a buildup of trash and human waste, and volunteer groups were required to intervene in an effort to perform whatever maintenance and cleaning they could. In January, it was widely reported that three deaths had occurred in national parks during the shutdown, although it\u2019s not at all clear that those deaths would have been prevented if the parks in question had been fully staffed. On 10 January, \u201cThe Other 98%\u201d Facebook page linked vandalism at the iconic Joshua Tree National Park in California to a lack of staff caused by the ongoing shutdown: \u201cDuring the shutdown, with Joshua Tree National Park open but no staff on duty, visitors cut down Joshua trees so they could drive into sensitive areas where vehicles are banned. The destroyed trees are irreplaceable; they take sixty years to mature and live for more than 500 years.\u201d          The key claim in the widely-shared meme, that staffing shortages contributed to the destruction of some of the iconic eponymous Yucca brevifolia trees at Joshua Tree National Park, is accurate, according to facts confirmed and descriptions provided by park management. Although it wasn\u2019t correct to say that \u201cno staff\u201d were on duty during the shutdown, staff numbers were very heavily diminished.  On 8 January, the National Park Service (NPS) announced that they would be temporarily closing Joshua Tree \u201cto allow park staff to address sanitation, safety, and resource protection issues in the park that have arisen during the lapse in appropriations\u201d: Park officials are identifying the additional staff and resources needed to address immediate maintenance and sanitation issues and will utilize funds from the park fees to address those issues per the recently updated National Park Service contingency plan during a lapse in appropriations. While the vast majority of those who visit Joshua Tree National Park do so in a responsible manner, there have been incidents of new roads being created by motorists and the destruction of Joshua trees in recent days that have precipitated the closure. Law enforcement rangers will continue to patrol the park and enforce the closure until park staff complete the necessary cleanup and park protection measures. In an interview with the National Parks Traveller website (which published a photograph of one of the downed trees), Joshua Tree National Park Superintendent David Smith gave further details on the vandalism perpetrated in the park in early January: \u201cThere are about a dozen instances of extensive vehicle traffic off roads and in some cases into wilderness,\u201d Smith replied when asked about the damage in the park. \u201cWe have two new roads that were created inside the park. We had destruction of government property with the cutting of chains and locks for people to access campgrounds. We\u2019ve never seen this level of out-of-bounds camping. Every day use area was occupied every evening. Joshua trees were actually cut down in order to make new roads.\u201d According to National Parks Traveller, Smith also drew a clear connection between the significant cut in staff numbers during the shutdown and the ability of park staff to monitor visitor behavior and prevent the kind of damage seen in recent days: Monitoring a park the size of Joshua Tree, which covers 1,235 square miles and has about 20 different entrances due to dirt roads that ring the park, is extremely difficult with just eight law enforcement rangers. Were it not for the shutdown, there would have been more than 100 other \u201csets of eyes\u201d to help keep an eye on visitor behavior, the superintendent said. \u201cWe have 120 employees in the park, plus 30 associates that work for Great Basin Institute, the majority of whom are in the park every day,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the folks that are in the campgrounds and in the day-use areas and doing science. So you\u2019ve got 100 sets of eyes in the park every day with folks contacting visitors.\u201d The following day, 9 January, the National Park Service announced a reversal of the decision to temporarily close Joshua Tree, writing that management, acting on a controversial directive from acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, would use funds derived from visitor fees in order to bring back the staff needed to keep the park open: By immediately utilizing revenue generated by recreation fees, National Park Service officials have been able to avert a temporary closure of Joshua Tree National Park that had been previously scheduled for January 10. In addition, recently closed areas of the park will once again be accessible to visitors starting January 10. Some visitor services, including campgrounds and entrance stations, will reopen utilizing recreation fee revenue. National Park Service officials have determined that by using Federal Land and Recreation Enhancement funds to immediately bring back park maintenance crews to address sanitation issues, the park will be able to maintain some visitor services, including reopening the campgrounds. Crucially, the announcement again drew a direct link between diminished staff numbers caused by the government shutdown, and the earlier destruction of trees at Joshua Tree National Park: The park will also bring on additional staff to ensure the protection of park resources and mitigate some of the damage that has occurred during the lapse of appropriations.

    "claim": "A comparison of two maps shows how most people in the United States seem to go missing near cave systems. ",
    "content": " An image graphic supposedly showing how a map of missing persons in the United States matches up with a map of America\u2019s largest cave systems is frequently shared on social media:  This may seem like an eerie coincidence at first glance. But when we took a closer look at where the maps originated and what they purportedly showed, the comparison seemed overstated. For starters, the top map is not an exhaustive list of every missing person in the United States. If you notice, the map doesn\u2019t show any missing persons in large metropolitan areas, like Detroit, Michigan. That\u2019s because it was created with the focus on people who \u201cmysteriously vanished\u201d in remote areas, specifically near national parks. And because national parks are home to nearly 5,000 caves, these two maps not surprisingly have some similarities. The original map of missing persons was created by David Paulides, a former detective and current Bigfoot hunter, for his \u201cMissing 411\u201d book series. The version of this map on his website shows a series of orange dots surrounded by various color markings, but it doesn\u2019t feature the hundreds of black dots shown on the viral map above. It appears that someone simply took the \u201ccave dots\u201d from the bottom map and overlaid them onto the \u201cmissing persons\u201d map. This may just explain why the two maps look so similar.          Here\u2019s a look at how these two maps compare when we use Paulides\u2019 original map (sans the black dots): Some parallels can still be drawn between the two maps (after all, Paulides was mapping people who \u201cmysteriously vanished\u201d near national parks, which are home to thousands of caves), but the similarities are not as clean.  As noted above, the people map is not an exhaustive list of all missing persons in the U.S. The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) reports that nearly 600,000 people go missing every year. Many of these cases are resolved with the persons being found alive and well, but tens of thousands of individuals will remain missing for more than a year. The vast majority of these missing-persons cases are not counted on this map.  The above-displayed people map only shows what Paulides calls \u201c411 cases,\u201d or cases Paulides has deemed as having strange circumstances. This could be a case involving dogs that failed to pick up a scent, people who were found with missing clothing items, or cases involving people who traveled unusual distances after they were last seen. The Skeptical Inquirer took a deeper look into Paulides\u2019 \u201c411 Cases,\u201d and while the Inquirer found that Paulides\u2019 work involved real cases of missing persons, many of the so-called strange circumstances had plausible explanations: Paulides has classified over 1,440 missing persons cases under the Missing411 label. At its core, Missing411 is the vague claim that something unusual is occurring related to deaths and disappearances in national parks. The concept has been steeped in the milieu of conspiracy and the supernatural, as Paulides frequently appears on paranormal-oriented radio shows and podcasts to discuss it. A forthcoming documentary appears to be in the works as well. (I have been unable to ascertain the meaning of 411. I can only speculate that it\u2019s a slang synonym for \u201cinformation,\u201d although \u201cMissingInfo\u201d isn\u2019t much better of a moniker.) [\u2026] I was finding these cases to be fairly mundane until I arrived at the hiker\u2019s disappearance. Following a deadpan factual reporting of the details, Paulides quotes a local person saying cryptically that \u201caccording to local legend, beings called Lemurians lived underneath Mount Shasta . . . maybe the Lemurians got Carl.\u201d The text is decorated sparsely with this and other head-scratching non sequiturs. For example, in the last case of my brief audit, a woman named Amy disappears while exercising. Her body was never recovered but her wristwatch was found in a river bed years later. Paulides points out that years after that, a woman named Ann disappeared from the same place. He felt the need to point out that \u201cboth of their names start with A, and their first names only had three letters.\u201d I can only presume Paulides is open to the possibility that some nefarious Batman villain is at work in this area. Beware the three-lettered killer! In short, the above-displayed maps \u2014 one showing people who mysteriously vanished, the other cave systems in the U.S. \u2014 do bare a few similarities. However, that\u2019s because the missing-persons map shows people who vanished under strange circumstances near national parks \u2014 which house thousands of caves \u2014 and not an exhaustive list of every person currently missing in the United States.

While the Falls sometimes are illuminated in a variety of colors at night, these displays typically consist of solid bands of colors (not shapes such as the maple leaf shown above).  The Niagara Parks Commission provided some details about the real \u201cFalls Illumination\u201d events on their website: Every evening beginning at dusk, Niagara Falls is transformed into an incredible, multi-coloured water and light masterpiece. Special lights are housed in the Illumination Tower, next to Queen Victoria Place; on the roof of Table Rock Centre, at the brink of the Horseshoe Falls; and deep in the Niagara Gorge, across from the American Falls. Together, these lights work to create a breathtaking view not to be missed. The falls are also lit in custom colours for short durations to mark significant dates in support of charitable causes.

In addition to these nightly light shows, the Falls are occasionally lit with specific colors in honor of special events and holidays. When the Toronto Raptors won the NBA championship, for instance, the waterfall was lit red:                   View this post on Instagram                            \u202aTonight as the @Raptors seek Canada\u2019s first ever @NBA Championship, Niagara Falls will once again be proudly lit in Raptor Red at 9:30pm! \u202c \u202a#WeTheNorth #Raptors #NiagaraParks #NiagaraFalls #DiscoverON #ExploreCanada #Niagara\u202c A post shared by  Niagara Parks (@niagaraparks) on Jun 10, 2019 at 5:50pm PDT            On Canada Day, the lights illuminate Niagara Falls in red and white, the colors of the Canadian flag \u2014 minus any maple leaf.  The above-displayed image was created by digitally editing a photograph of the Niagara Falls\u2019 Canada Day display that was posted to Reddit in 2018. Here\u2019s a look at the edited image (left) and the original image (right): Chris Giles, travel media relations and content coordinator for Niagara Parks, confirmed that the image to the left \u201chas been photoshopped.\u201d Angela Berti, a spokesperson with New York State Parks, told us: \u201cThere was NO projection of the Canadian flag on the Falls. That is not a practice that is allowed. The Falls are lit each night, however, by the Niagara Falls Illumination Board, a binational organization that oversees the lighting of the Falls. We work hard to keep the Falls as natural as possible.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the only digitally altered picture of the Canadian flag on Niagara Falls to circulate on Canada Day 2019. This is also such a picture:  This picture was originally submitted to Worth1000.com (now DesignCrowd.com) in 2005 for the \u201cNationalism 2\u201d Photoshop contest: The rules of the contest explained: \u201cJust look in the crowd at any international sporting event. National pride is bursting at the seams. Body paint galore. Now we want you to take this idea a little farther. Place national symbols/flags on any random object. Don\u2019t just place a flag marking on someone\u2019s face. How boring, how unoriginal. You can do better than that.\u201d "

    "claim": "Turkey legs sold in Disney's theme are actually emu legs.",
    "content": " Rumors that the turkey legs sold at Disney\u2019s theme parks are in actuality emu meat have long been in circulation in the online world, and the claim got a boost when it was reference during a 9 March 2017 segment on TBS\u2019 Conan talk show:  In the segment, actor Zachary Levi (who voiced the character Flynn in the Disney film  Tangled) said: \u201cThe turkey legs at Disneyland, I\u2019ve come to find out, are not actually turkey. They\u2019re emu legs. Shocker right? No I swear. I have friends that have worked for Disneyland, and I was talking about how the turkey legs tasted more like ham than they tasted like turkey, which is already befuddling, and they said, \u2018Well, they\u2019re actually emu. Those are big, big old emu legs.\u2019 So if you\u2019ve had a turkey leg at Disneyland, you\u2019ve eaten an emu, folks.\u201d          This false rumor had already been addressed in the press multiple times, as in a 2012 the Orlando Sentinel short item about emus: (For the record, Robert Adams, executive chef at Walt Disney World\u2019s Magic Kingdom confirms the turkey legs are not made of emu. \u201cWe hear that all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re real turkeys. It\u2019s what they are.\u201d) In 2013, the New York Times ran the same claim by a turkey industry expert, who disclaimed and noted that many consumers were confused because the turkey legs sold in Disney parks are typically bigger than what people are used to seeing in their Thanksgiving dinners: Just about everyone who comes into contact with these legs seems to have two questions: Are these really from turkeys? If so \u2014 if they\u2019re not emu or ostrich, two urban myths \u2014 then why are they so big? People are accustomed to Thanksgiving turkeys, which are female birds, or hens; the males, called toms, are bigger \u2014 up to 50 pounds apiece \u2014 and their legs are the ones that Disney serves, said Keith M. Williams, a vice president at the National Turkey Federation, an industry trade group. In March 2017, the Orlando Sentinel revisited the rumor, citing a wildlife expert, a food expert, and an executive chef at Disney who explained why the rumor wasn\u2019t credible: A emu leg is eight times larger than a turkey leg, said Tim Williams of Gatorland, which had emu at its attraction. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to walk around with an emu leg in a theme park and chew on it, you\u2019d have to get a cart with wheels to push that thing around. They\u2019re huge,\u201d Williams said. Theme park legs don\u2019t taste like emu, said Andrew Zimmern, the \u201cBizarre Foods\u201d guy. \u201cThe meat would be a little more beefy,\u201d he said. \u201cEmu has the consistency of turkey leg but the flavor of roasted veal. It\u2019s got mild beefiness to it and a little more metallic.\u201d But why are they so dang big then? The size can be attributed to a worldwide increase in turkey demand, said Disney\u2019s Robert Adams, who five years ago was executive chef at Magic Kingdom. Consumers mostly want white breast meat, so growers are raising bigger turkeys, he said. The relative costs of emu versus turkey also makes rumors about the sale of emu legs at Disney parks implausible, as  reported in 2015 by National Geographic: Emu meat is also costly for consumers, who generally buy the products online or at local stores. A pound of emu costs anywhere from $25 to $30, whereas even the most expensive cut of beef costs an average of $8 a pound. When emu came onto the scene, there were too many birds and not enough buyers willing to pay such high prices. By contrast, an annual Thanksgiving cost breakdown puts the price of turkey at under $1.50 per pound, making emu meat 16 to 20 times more expensive (and as such, far too expensive to sell as a realistic turkey substitute).  Finally, the sale of emu meat falsely identified as turkey at Disney theme parks would fall afoul of the Federal Meat Inspection Act, which prohibits the sale of mislabeled meat.  "

    "claim": "Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution holds that \"the Federal Government shall never own title to any real property which is not specifically authorized by this Constitution such as parks, forests, dams, waterways, and grazing areas without the consent of the State where same is located.\"",
    "content": " On 2 January 2016, an event known as the \u201cMalheur Occupation\u201d or \u201cOregon Standoff\u201d began at the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon. The armed militia that occupied the building on the reserve said they were doing so in order to protest overreach by the federal government after two ranchers were sentenced to prison for arson on public lands. The standoff mostly ended on 26 January 2016, when one occupier was shot and killed by police at a traffic stop, and eleven more were arrested. One of the discussions that ensued as a result of this was government ownership of land. Social media users focused a number of posts and tweets at policies and practices relating to the Bureau of Land Management, particularly a common assertion about the legality of federally-managed lands when considered in light of a portion of the U.S. Constitution that supposedly states: The Federal Government shall never own title to any real property which is not specifically authorized by this Constitution such as parks, forests, dams, waterways, and grazing areas without the consent of the State where same is located. However, these words do not appear anywhere in the U.S. Constitution, so an argument that the Constitution specifically prohibits the federal government from \u201cowning title\u201d to \u201cgrazing areas\u201d (without the permission of the states in which those areas are located) fails on that basis. Some online pundits have asserted that the specific wording at issue here is found in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution (at \u201cClause 17,\u201d although it is not numbered as such), which reads:  The Congress shall have Power: To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings.          Some background is necessary to understand this clause in its proper context.  Since the legislative branch (i.e., Congress) was the only branch of federal government that existed at the time the Constitution was written, that document\u2019s framers expected it to be the most important branch of government and took care to list its powers in considerable detail right up front in Article I.  Hence that article contains \u201cthe laundry list of federal powers,\u201d including Section 8, which sets forth the enumerated powers of Congress (i.e., powers that are specifically listed as belonging to the national government).  Those  enumerated powers include the power to tax, the power to spend revenues for the \u201ccommon defense and general welfare of the United States,\u201d to regulate commerce, to coin money, to establish post offices and roads, to declare war, to raise and support an army and navy. The so-called \u201cClause 17\u201d of Article I, Section 8 deals with the issue that the Constitution\u2019s framers had agreed that the new nation\u2019s capital should be located in a district that was independent any particular state government and subject only to federal control.  Thus the plan was to create a federal district no more than ten miles square from land ceded by one or more states to house the U.S. national capital, which was accomplished when the Compromise of 1790 ended with agreement to form the District of Columbia from landed ceded by Maryland and Virginia.  The national capital was temporarily relocated from New York to Philadelphia while construction began on homes for the president and Congress, and in 1800 the United States\u2019 capital was moved again (for the final time) to Washington, D.C., in December 1800. \u201cClause 17\u201d merely allows Congress to exercise exclusive control over that federal district, and over any structures constructed there deemed necessary for carrying on the business of the national government (such as forts, arsenals, and post offices).  It does not preclude the federal government from purchasing or holding title to other land within the various states, or from using public land for purposes such as establishing and managing parks, forests, dams, waterways, and grazing areas without the consent of the states in which those facilities are located.   In fact, the following clause (commonly known as the \u201cNecessary and Proper Clause\u201d or the \u201cElastic Clause\u201d) grants Congress the authority to carry out its enumerated powers, and that clause has since been broadly interpreted to allow the national government management over areas designated as national parks, federal public works projects such as dams and waterways, and livestock grazing on public rangelands. It\u2019s possible that some advocates of the \u201cno title to any real property\u201d viewpoint might be confusing the actual U.S. Constitution with language found in the so-called \u201cTexas Constitution 2000\u201d (which was not an actual piece of legislation, but rather an unofficial proposed revision of the existing Texas state constitution), which contained a clause stating that \u201cGovernment shall never own title to any real property which is not specifically authorized by this constitution.\u201d "

    "claim": "A photograph shows Donald Trump, Muhammad Ali, and Rosa Parks after receiving the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 1986.",
    "content": " In the summer of 2016, as Donald Trump made strong arguments against immigration and said that he would build a border wall and deport illegal immigrants, the following photograph circulated, showing the Republican presidential nominee alongside Muhammad Ali and Rosa Parks:  While Donald Trump has battled accusations of racism throughout his 2016 presidential campaign (and throughout much of his career), his supporters have shared the above-displayed photograph as proof that Trump is not racist. When The American Mirror published this photograph on 4 September 2016, they asserted that Trump had never been accused of racism before he ran for president (which is demonstrably false) and argued that if Trump were a racist, he would have never posed for a photograph with Ali and Parks: No one accused Donald Trump of being a racist until he decided to run for president and became a threat to Hillary Clinton\u2019s return to power. In 1986, Trump joined several other prominent Americans, such as Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali, as recipients of an \u201cEllis Island Award.\u201d One suspects if Trump was a racist, there\u2019s no way he would have posed for a photo with those two.         The photograph is real. It was taken on 27 October 1986 by Getty photographer Yvonne Hemsey at a ceremony honoring the recipients of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. (Joe DiMaggio, Victor Borge, and Anita Bryant are also featured in the photograph.) The Ellis Island Medal of Honor is awarded each year in celebration of \u201cpatriotism, tolerance, brotherhood and diversity\u201d: The Ellis Island Medals of Honor embody the spirit of America in their celebration of patriotism, tolerance, brotherhood and diversity. They recognize individuals who have made it their mission to share with those less fortunate their wealth of knowledge, indomitable courage, boundless compassion, unique talents and selfless generosity; all while maintaining the traditions of their ethnic heritage as they uphold the ideals and spirit of America. As always, NECO remains dedicated to the maintenance and restoration of America\u2019s greatest symbol of its immigrant history, Ellis Island. Trump was one of 80 individuals to receive the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 1986, the first year that the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations handed out the award. However,  the fact that Donald Trump received the award and posed for a photograph says little about his motivations or whether or not he has racist tendencies, only that he received an award and participated in a ceremony meant to honor him (and others). Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was similarly honored with the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 1999. "
