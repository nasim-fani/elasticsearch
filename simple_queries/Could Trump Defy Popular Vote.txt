    "claim": "As of mid-November, several battleground states had not certified results of the popular vote in the 2020 presidential race, which meant U.S. President Donald Trump had an opportunity to defy the election's outcome.",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. In mid-November 2020, after U.S. Democrat Joe Biden secured the majority of the country\u2019s electoral votes in the presidential race against President Donald Trump, an email from the sitting president\u2019s campaign to supporters implied that the country\u2019s constitutionally mandated elections process allowed time for Trump to defy the outcome of the popular vote. (Read more fact checks like this one here.) \u201cJoe Biden has NOT been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or any states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor,\u201d read a Nov. 13 Trump fundraising email obtained by Snopes.  The email alleged that states had not certified results of the 2020 election and Trump\u2019s political enemies were wrongfully trying to convince Americans that a Biden presidency was inevitable when it wasn\u2019t.         The claim was two-pronged: Key battleground states had not certified results of the popular vote, and because of that Trump had a chance to defy its outcome. First, let\u2019s define what step in the country\u2019s election process \u2014 which functions under the Constitution, federal statutes, and state laws \u2014 to which the campaign was referring. Every four years in America, people submit ballots in a popular vote for the president. Most states grant counties the authority to administer those elections via a board of electors, an election official or officials, or both. Those local jurisdictions operate under varying timelines for processing votes. As they begin to publish unofficial voter tallies via secretary of state websites or other government-run databases on election night, statisticians compare the sum of votes counted to the difference in totals between the losing and winning candidate. When there appears to be no statistical chance for a losing candidate to overcome the competitor in a state, journalists \u201ccall\u201d the race and project a winner there. As a result, that candidate receives that state\u2019s total number of electoral votes. In the Trump-Biden contest, the news media did not announce a winner in several states until days after polls closed, in part, due to an unprecedented surge in mail-in voting and states\u2019 varying rules for when they can start processing those ballots. See National Public Radio\u2019s graphic showing deadlines below, based on data from state elections offices, the National League for State Legislatures, and Ballotpedia:  On Nov. 7, however, Biden secured the majority of the country\u2019s electoral votes (again, based on unofficial voter tallies), and was announced the 46th President of the United States.        Historically, it is that point in the election process \u2014 when ballots haven\u2019t been certified at the county or state level \u2014 that a losing candidate concedes defeat. That acknowledgment, while not constitutionally required, has come to represent a losing candidates\u2019 willingness to help the winner transition\u2019s into the White House. It also serves to help the losing candidate\u2019s supporters accept the election\u2019s outcome. Cue the above-mentioned claim about Trump having a chance at another term and that the election\u2019s \u201cultimate victor\u201d was yet to be decided. The Associated Press reported: Certifying results is a routine yet important step after local election officials have tallied votes, reviewed procedures, checked to ensure votes were counted correctly and investigated discrepancies. Typically, this certification is done by a local board of elections and then, later, the results are certified at the state level. But as Trump has refused to concede to Biden and continues to spread false claims of victory, this mundane process is taking on new significance. Under state and federal laws, the process of cementing voter tallies continues regardless of a candidate\u2019s acceptance of the popular vote. First, local election boards certify ballots at a precinct level. After that, state executive authorities seal state\u2019s results via a \u201cCertificate of Ascertainment\u201d \u2014 a document that lists the names of the state\u2019s chosen electors who will cast official votes for president through the Electoral College. (State legislatures decide how to appoint electors and their necessary qualifications.) Deadlines for completing certifications vary state by state under local laws. According to MIT Technology Review, such dates for battleground states were: Georgia\u2019s certification deadline is November 20.  Pennsylvania counties must submit certification by November 23.  Michigan\u2019s certification deadline is November 23. Nevada\u2019s certification deadline is November 24.  Arizona\u2019s certification deadline is November 30. Wisconsin\u2019s certification deadline is December 1. Once completed, governors submit their \u201cCertificate of Ascertainment\u201d to the U.S. Archivist. The electors listed on the document then meet at state capitals to formally cast their votes for president and vice president on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, per guidelines outlined in the Constitution. In 2020, that\u2019s Dec. 14.        In other words, it was accurate to state, as of mid-November, several battleground states had not certified results of the popular vote, including Georgia, where the state\u2019s Republican secretary of state ordered a manual recount of ballots and Biden led by a slim margin of 0.3 percentage points. However, less clear was whether that fact meant Trump had a chance to overturn Biden\u2019s victory. Via lawsuits and campaign messages to supporters, like the above-displayed fundraising email, the Trump campaign was trying to convince Americans that governments should hold off on certifying ballots because widespread voter fraud tainted the numbers, even though no evidence showed that was true. Matt Morgan, the Trump campaign\u2019s general counsel, said the push to try to delay or stop voter certification in battleground states aimed to give the campaign more time to get a handle on voter tallies and whether it would have the right to automatic recounts, according to The Associated Press. Additionally, some Trump allies wanted to slow down the process to give GOP-controlled legislatures an opportunity to pick a slate of electors who would overturn Biden\u2019s victory through the Electoral College or send the election to the U.S. House of Representatives. (Read here for how Congress would decide the outcome of the 2020 election, pending what happens with the Electoral College.) As of this writing, two Republican election officials in Michigan\u2019s Wayne County had refused to certify results of the popular vote, citing the unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud, and then reversed course on Nov. 17. GOP officials in Arizona were also trying to pressure county officials to delay the process, per news reports. Simultaneously, Trump allies in Michigan and Nevada pushed lawsuits attempting to stop voter certification. University of Kentucky Law Professor Joshua Douglas told The Associated Press there was no precedent for such an effort to delay or undermine the typically sleepy step in the country\u2019s presidential elections. \u201cIt would be the end of democracy as we know it,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cThis is just not a thing that can happen.\u201d We should note here: The emails from Trump\u2019s campaign about states certifying voting results asked supporters to chip in to a so-called \u201cOfficial Election Defense Fund\u201d or \u201cElection Defense Task Force,\u201d both of which the campaign framed as costly initiatives involving ballot recounts or various lawsuits to challenge Biden\u2019s win. But according to Brendan Fischer, director of the federal reform program at Campaign Legal Center, the average donor\u2019s money was not covering those expenses. Rather, people were giving their money to the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, where contributions are divided between Trump\u2019s committees and the Republican National Committee.  \u201cSmall donors who give to Trump thinking they are financing an \u2018official election defense fund\u2019 are in fact helping pay down the Trump campaign\u2019s debt or funding his post-presidential political operation,\u201d Fischer tweeted. In sum, while it was true to claim states had not certified results of the popular vote, the resulting success of the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to intervene in that typically procedural step remained unknown at the time of this writing, and it was erroneous to claim that a winner of the election had not been named. For those reasons, we rate the allegation in the fundraising email a \u201cmixture\u201d of accurate, undetermined, and false information. "

    "claim": "As of mid-November 2020, the U.S. presidential election remained \"far from over,\" thus enough uncertainty about the outcome remained that U.S. President Donald Trump could reasonably claim he might still be the winner.",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. In mid-November 2020, after all major news organizations declared former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden the winner of the presidential election, President Donald Trump\u2018s campaign claimed in a series of fundraising emails that the election was \u201cfar from over,\u201d and that supporters should not believe messages to the contrary. (Read more fact checks like this one here.) In other words, the emails claimed either Biden or Trump could serve as the country\u2019s 46th president come Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, 2021 \u2014 even though Biden won key battleground states, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, by comfortable vote margins and exceeded the 270 Electoral College votes required to win the presidency.  The emails \u2014 like the president\u2019s tweets that falsely claimed he had won or denied Biden\u2019s victory \u2014 were part of an aggressive disinformation campaign attempting to attack the integrity of America\u2019s democratic process and convince supporters that Trump had a significant chance to serve another term.         \u201cJoe Biden only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING. We have a long way to go \u2014 this was a flawed ELECTION,\u201d said a Nov. 19 campaign email obtained by Snopes.  To unpack the underlying claim \u2014 that American elections provide losing candidates an opportunity to defy the outcome of the popular vote \u2014 let\u2019s first lay out the country\u2019s steps for presidential elections under the Constitution, federal statutes, and state laws. Every four years, when Americans cast ballots in presidential elections, they are participating in the country\u2019s popular vote. That happened Nov. 3 in the Trump-Biden race. Days later on Nov. 7, Biden was announced the winner of the popular vote based on the number of votes counted so far compared to the margin of votes between him and Trump in key battleground states. (Read why and how journalists make that determination in presidential races here.) Typically, at that point in an election, the losing candidate acknowledges defeat by conceding to his opponent and addressing supporters in a speech. But Trump not only did not do that, he and his allies went a step further by spewing the unfounded conspiracy theory that any person or group who acknowledged  Biden\u2019s victory was working to undermine the president. Whether a candidate accepts the outcome of the popular vote or not, state officials at polling sites nationwide continue to count remaining ballots over the course of days or weeks, according to their respective rules. That process, which historically is a procedural step to cement the outcome of the popular vote, requires governors to prepare what\u2019s called a \u201cCertificate of Ascertainment\u201d that lists their state\u2019s slate of electors. For example, Biden won the popular vote in Minnesota, so that\u2019s state\u2019s certificate would list 10 Democratic electors who pledged to vote for Biden through the Electoral College.        Likewise, if, hypothetically, Trump had won the Midwestern state, the state\u2019s certificate would list a different group of 10 people \u2014 electors who pledged to vote for the Republican candidate. All of this said, electors meet at state capitals in early December, weeks after Election Day, to formally cast votes for president and vice president, per guidelines outlined in the Constitution. No constitutional provision, nor any federal law, requires electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote; however, the majority of states and the District of Columbia have their own laws governing the Electoral College and aim to keep electors from defying the popular vote. Here are specific deadlines for those above-described steps in presidential elections, per The Associated Press: Dec. 8 is the deadline for resolving election disputes at the state level. All state recounts and court contests over presidential election results are to be completed by this date. Dec. 14: Electors vote by paper ballot in their respective states and the District of Columbia. Thirty-three states and D.C. have laws or party regulations requiring electors to vote the same way the popular vote goes in the state, and in some states, electors can even be replaced or subjected to penalties, according to the Congressional Research Service. Dec. 23: The certificates must be delivered to the designated officials. If they are not delivered, the law provides alternative avenues for getting the results to Washington. Jan. 6, 2021: The House and Senate hold a joint session to count the electoral votes. If one ticket has received 270 or more electoral votes, the president of the Senate, currently Vice President Mike Pence, announces the results. So, in short, a presidential election doesn\u2019t end on Election Day, nor when a candidate is projected the winner by news media. Rather, presidential elections officially conclude the following year, in January. But it\u2019s a false interpretation of state and federal laws governing presidential elections to consider those continuing steps after polls close on Election Day \u2014 when states certify results or choose electors, or the Electoral College votes for president \u2014 as opportunities to defy the popular vote. Per analysis of the guidelines by constitutional experts and election academics, the post-election day procedures mainly serve to cement what voters decided at the county and state level. We should note here: The emails from Trump\u2019s campaign alleging the election was \u201cfar from over\u201d asked supporters to chip in to a so-called \u201cOfficial Election Defense Fund\u201d or \u201cElection Defense Task Force,\u201d both of which the campaign framed as costly initiatives involving ballot recounts or various lawsuits to challenge Biden\u2019s win. But according to Brendan Fischer, director of the federal reform program at Campaign Legal Center, the average donor\u2019s money was not covering those expenses.  \u201cSmall donors who give to Trump thinking they are financing an \u2018official election defense fund\u2019 are in fact helping pay down the Trump campaign\u2019s debt or funding his post-presidential political operation,\u201d Fischer tweeted. In sum, it was accurate to claim the 2020 presidential election was incomplete as of mid-November. However, it was false to categorize the remaining procedures as reasonable opportunities for Trump to overturn Biden\u2019s victory. For those reasons, we rate this claim \u201cMostly False.\u201d "

    "claim": "State legislatures can override the results of elections and designate whichever presidential electors they choose. ",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. As Americans exhaustively discuss (and often lament) in every presidential election year, the United States does not choose its chief executive based on whichever candidate receives the largest number of votes in a national election, but via an electoral college system under which each of the individual states holds a separate election to select a slate of electors who cast their votes for president. This unique approach means that sometimes \u2014 as happened in 2000 and again in 2016 \u2014 the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide does not ultimately win the overall election. When that phenomenon occurs (and sometimes even when it doesn\u2019t), partisans of the losing candidate start ruminating about ways to \u201cgame\u201d the electoral college system to install their preferred choice in the White House regardless. One example of this trend\u2019s playing out in 2020, when U.S. President Donald Trump apparently lost both the popular and the electoral vote, yet he, and many of his supporters, claimed victory nonetheless and asserted claims (without credible evidence) that substantial election fraud had taken place. Some voices proclaimed that states in which Republicans controlled the state legislature should choose electors favoring Trump, no matter how the residents of those states may have voted:  REMINDER TO THE REPUBLICAN STATE LEGISLATURES, YOU HAVE THE FINAL SAY OVER THE CHOOSING OF ELECTORS, NOT ANY BOARD OF ELECTIONS, SECRETARY OF STATE, GOVERNOR, OR EVEN COURT. YOU HAVE THE FINAL SAY \u2014 ARTICLE II OF THE FED CONSTITUTION. SO, GET READY TO DO YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY \u2014 Mark R. Levin (@marklevinshow) November 5, 2020          The scheme proposed here reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how the U.S. electoral college system and electoral law function, however. When the framers of the U.S. Constitution outlined the workings of the electoral college system, they didn\u2019t specify how presidential electors should or must be chosen, leaving it up to the various state legislatures to each decide for themselves how to appoint their electors: \u201cEach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress \u2026\u201d This passage meant that state legislatures could opt to choose electors themselves, or appoint a commission to designate electors, or hold a lottery, or flip a coin, or employ whatever other method they saw fit. However, it does not mean that, as suggested by the above tweet, state legislatures now have carte blanche to simply ignore election results and choose whichever presidential electors they want. After the U.S. Constitution was ratified and went into effect in 1788, states generally used a combination of selection by legislatures and selection by popular vote for designating their electors. By 1864, though, every state had adopted laws establishing the practice of popular voting for electors. For the most part, each political party submits a list of electors who are pledged to vote for that party\u2019s candidate to state elections officials, and after the election the state appoints the electors submitted by the party of whichever presidential candidate received the most votes. The website of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) describes this process: The U.S. Constitution does not specify procedures for the nomination of candidates for presidential elector. The two most common methods the states have adopted are nomination by state party convention and by state party committee. Generally, the parties select members known for their loyalty and service to the party, such as party leaders, state and local elected officials and party activists. In some states, the electors\u2019 names appear on the ballot along with the names of the candidates for president and vice president. However, in most states, electors\u2019 names are not printed on the ballot. When a voter casts a vote for a candidate for President of the United States, s/he is in actuality casting a vote for the presidential electors who were selected by that candidate\u2019s party. [W]hen a candidate for president wins a state\u2019s popular vote, that party\u2019s slate of electors will be the ones to cast the vote for president of the United States in December. For example, Florida has 29 electoral votes. If President Donald Trump wins the state\u2019s popular vote on Nov. 3, the 29 electors nominated by the Republican Party in Florida will be selected. These 29 people will gather on Dec. 14 to cast their votes for president of the United States. Although the wording of Article II of the Constitution (quoted above) allows that any state\u2019s legislature could opt for a different method of picking electors in the future, it does not empower any legislature to ignore both their state\u2019s elections results and their existing laws and, willy-nilly, designate whomever they want as electors. (In reference to the NCSL passage quoted above, for example, Democratic legislators in Florida could not decline to recognize Donald Trump as the winner in that state\u2019s election and appoint electors chosen by the Democratic party instead.) Any state\u2019s legislature could, theoretically, pass a law setting out a new method for designating presidential electors other than popular vote. However, they would have enact such a law prior to Election Day; they could not retroactively change, or just disregard, their current laws to defy the will of voters. State election laws and regulations must be established and in place prior to Election Day \u2014 they cannot be improvised or instituted on an ad hoc basis after the fact. Otherwise, every presidential election would descend into chaos, with state legislatures controlled by one party refusing to appoint electors pledged to the other party\u2019s candidate, as the Lawfare blog observed: The legal theory that would allow state legislatures to go rogue and appoint electors without regard for the popular vote rests on an argument made by Chief Justice William Rehnquist in Bush v. Gore, for himself and two other justices. On this view, a legislature is unconstrained in its power to set the manner by which electors are selected \u2014 meaning that even after an election, the legislature could ignore the results and select a different slate altogether. A recent opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggests that Rehnquist\u2019s argument may be again on the rise. But advocates for this view need to recognize that between Bush v. Gore and today, the Supreme Court has unanimously decided that presidential electors are not actually \u201celectors\u201d but are instead bound to the people\u2019s vote. That principle that cabins elector discretion must also constrain legislatures \u2014 at least if the country is to avoid an abomination that the Framers expressly rejected. That said, the law is only relevant to the extent that is it enforceable. If Republican-dominated legislatures were determined to find excuses for ignoring their states\u2019 election results, a Republican-controlled Senate were willing to facilitate the scheme, and a conservative judiciary were compliant in upholding the results, then such a plot might indeed succeed.

    "claim": "In Georgia's U.S. Senate runoff election on Jan. 5, 2021, a majority of write-in ballots for Trump would elect him to the U.S. Senate, or alternatively, undermine Republican candidates.",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. In late November 2020, after U.S. President-elect Joe Biden secured the battleground state of Georgia in the presidential election, a social media campaign emerged claiming his opponent, U.S. President Donald Trump, would have a chance to serve in the U.S. Senate if enough people voted for him in the state\u2019s upcoming runoffs. The Jan. 5, 2021, runoff election between incumbent Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue and Democrats the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff will decide whether Republicans or Democrats control the upper chamber at the outset of a Biden administration. Georgia election rules call for runoff races when no candidate exceeds 50% of voter share in either race during the general election.  But with the hashtag #WriteInTrumpForGA on platforms including Twitter and Parler, an online haven for conservatives, posts attempted to convince Georgia voters to write in Trump\u2019s name and elect him to the Senate, even though he was not a candidate.  \u201cWe need to cover ALL bases in our stop the steal efforts, and one of these is simply utilizing our voice for the GA runoffs and writing in Donald J Trump for senate,\u201d read one Parler post. \u201c[We] can maintain a senate majority with TRUMP as the majority leader! We can put a STOP to the democrats!\u201d         The underlying message of some posts echoed Trump\u2019s attacks on Georgia Republican state officials who oversaw the process for certifying votes in the presidential race. In tweets and emails to supporters soliciting donations, the Trump campaign called on Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to break state laws governing the democratic process and defy the outcome of the popular vote that awarded Georgia\u2019s 16 electoral votes to Biden. He won by fewer than 13,000 votes out of about 5 million cast. Some Parler posts obtained by Snopes, such as the ones displayed below, lumped Senate candidates Loeffler and Perdue into that group of Republicans who were not acceding to the Trump campaign\u2019s requests to delegitimize Biden\u2019s win by spreading baseless allegations that Dominion Voting Systems software had altered votes.   \u201cThe president has basically taken hostage this race,\u201d said Brendan Buck, once a top adviser to former House Speaker Paul Ryan, per The Associated Press. In short, some posts wanted Georgia voters to write in Trump\u2019s name to supposedly help him win a Senate seat. Meanwhile, others promoted the #WriteInTrumpForGA campaign not to necessarily elect Trump but to \u201cpunish\u201d Loeffler and Perdue, since participating voters would, in theory, otherwise have voted for the Senate Republican candidates. The assumption behind the former approach \u2014 that Trump had a realistic chance to serve in the Senate \u2014 was false, but the latter reasoning had some validity to it, which we explain below. First, though, let us lay out laws governing runoff elections. Georgia is one of 10 U.S. states where statutes require runoff elections when no candidate receives more than 50% of votes in a general election. Per Georgia Code Title 21. Elections \u00a7 21-2-501:        \u201cIn instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, a run-off primary, special primary runoff, run-off election, or special election runoff between the candidates receiving the two highest numbers of votes shall be held.\u201d That means, per state law, all runoffs in Georgia only allow two candidates (the top two vote-getters in general elections) per race on ballots. So in the Jan. 5 Georgia runoffs, ballots allow voters the options of selecting either Loeffler or Warnock in one race, or Perdue or Ossoff in the other (see the sample ballot below). There is no line allocated for a write-in option, no matter if people cast paper ballots or use touch-screen voting.   An Attempt To \u2018Tilt The Balance In Trump\u2019s Favor\u2019 Nonetheless, people in theory could still answer the social media campaign\u2019s request to write in Trump\u2019s name on ballots unofficially, perhaps in the paper\u2019s margins or next to the Senate candidates\u2019 names. But that scribbling would not be an official vote for the sitting president (or anyone) for numerous reasons. Namely, as stated, Trump was not among the top two vote-getters in Georgia\u2019s Senate races, so the law does not consider him a viable candidate in the runoffs.  Additionally, since the ballots do not include an official line for write-in candidates, writing outside of the bubbles for official candidates could force election officials to invalidate the paperwork all together, per laws governing the ballot-counting process. The statutes require poll workers to scan ballots for improper markings or other defects before they feed them into tabulation machines for official vote counts. As a result, spoiled or defective ballots are not legally counted in elections.        Given that fact, opponents of Trump co-opted #WriteInTrumpForGA in attempt to help Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia. If a significant number of Republican voters wrote Trump on their ballots \u2014 and, as a result, election officials had to invalidate their votes under state law \u2014 the race\u2019s Democratic candidates could reap the benefit, and Republicans could risk losing a Senate majority.  That communications strategy to convince die-hard conservatives that voting for Loeffler and Perdue would defy Trump\u2019s political agenda (cryptically in the name of helping Democrats) manifested in other ways, too. An anti-Trump political organization called \u201cReally American PAC\u201d was supposedly soliciting donations on ActBlue, a fundraising processor for Democratic campaigns, to pay for the billboards displayed below. At least one Twitter user claimed to have seen one of the signs in real life. \u201cIf Trump supporters deliver Perdue and Loeffler a victory, they should be acutely aware that they will be delivering Trump and MAGA a serious political defeat,\u201d read a statement by the PAC.  A website, writeintrumpforgeorgiasenate.com, was also part of that tongue-in-cheek campaign effort, per an attorney for an opposing political action group. The website read:         \u201cWith enough write-ins in the Georgia senate race, we can tilt the balance in Georgia in Trump\u2019s favor! If we can do this, we have a real chance at getting these RINO senators to act on the illegitimate and corrupt election presided over by a Democrat party that is invested in the Communist takeover of Our Great Nation. \u201d The site says it was funded by the political group \u201cCommittee for American Sovereignty,\u201d which according to news reports was created in 2016 to help Republican operatives \u2014 including Trump\u2019s longtime political confidant Roger Stone \u2014 undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign by spewing an unfounded conspiracy theory that Bill Clinton had an illegitimate biracial son. The Daily Beast, however, reported that Paul Jensen, an attorney for the committee, refuted its connection to the website, and alleged its \u201cgoal is to elect the Democrat candidate, suggesting that a Democrat-leaning entity, not the Committee for American Sovereignty, is behind it.\u201d Effects of Political Communication Schemes Remain Unknown On Nov. 23, Donald Trump Jr. refuted the messages urging Trump supporters to abstain from voting for Loeffler and Perdue.  More than a week later, as Trump prepared for a Dec. 5 visit to Georgia to campaign alongside Perdue and Loeffler, the president echoed that sentiment, saying in a tweet \u201cwe must work hard\u201d to ensure victories for the Republican Senate candidates.  In sum, the outcome of the runoffs remained unknown; therefore, it was unclear how any ballots, much less those with invalid markings for Trump, would impact results. But if, instead of voting for Loeffler or Perdue, a significant number of Republican voters unofficially wrote Trump\u2019s name on their ballots \u2014 and, as a result, election officials had to throw out those ballots\u2014 Democrats\u2019 vote margins would benefit. Depending on the level of participation in that protest, it could undermine Senate Republicans\u2019 chance at securing the chamber\u2019s majority. Nonetheless, state and federal laws governing elections would not allow voters the opportunity to elect Trump to the Senate in the runoffs. For those reasons, we rate this claim \u201cMostly false.\u201d "

    "claim": "President Obama has announced he'll refuse to leave office if Donald Trump is elected President.",
    "content": " A 6 September 2016 article on the web site The Burrard Street Journal claimed President Obama told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer in an interview that \u201cin the best interests of our nation,\u201d he\u2019ll refuse to leave office if GOP candidate Donald Trump is elected President: The current president claims he is \u201cfully prepared\u201d to ignore the popular vote if it means stopping Trump, having found what he believes is a little known loophole that would allow him to remain in charge until a re-election is called. \u201cAs president, I must do what I feel is in the best interests of our nation,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf the American people elected \u2018the Donald\u2019 then I will be forced to take whatever actions I deem necessary.\u201d When asked by the CNN anchor if he would remain in charge, Obama\u2019s response was firm. \u201cI am not standing down as president if it means four years of President Trump,\u201d he said categorically. The article was widely shared via social media by two separate constituencies, each for its own different, yet related, reason. One reason is that it taps into an undercurrent of paranoia that resurfaces every four years based on the fear that an incumbent president will circumvent the democratic process and defy the Constitution in order to avoid having to relinquish power.  Two, it\u2019s a passably amusing spoof of that conspiracist mentality. As we\u2019ve had occasion to observe previously, The Burrard Street Journal doesn\u2019t publish real news. As stated on its disclaimer page, the web site\u2019s content is purely satirical: All burrardstreetjournal.com, FM News or FM Football News articles are satirical and entirely fabricated. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental, except for all references to sports personalities and/or celebrities, in which case they are based on real people, but still based almost entirely in fiction.

The story reads: President Donald J. Trump, alleged-billionaire and former reality-TV star, signed an order today that stated \u201cdespite what so-called facts and easily observable reality dictates, President Trump was the clear winner of the popular vote in the 2016 election.\u201d The order stipulates that \u201ceven if the actual facts don\u2019t show this to be true, alternative facts most certainly will.\u201d The order also says \u201cTrump deserves the popular vote win anyway, so no one should get all that mad, really.\u201d \u201cLook, many people have told me that they think I\u2019m spending way too much time thinking about this whole popular vote thing,\u201d Trump said as he signed the order, \u201cand so my thought process on this Executive Order \u2014 and by the way I do the best Executive Orders don\u2019t I? Anyway, the thinking behind this one was that if I just end all the hubbub and debate over who won the popular vote, then we can get on with the business of rounding up Mexicans and banning Muslims, know what I mean?\u201d The post is purely satire, meant to play on President Trump\u2019s days-long fixation over the crowd size at his 20 January 2017 inauguration and promise to investigate voter fraud in the election that he won by electoral college. (Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots.) The story also plays on the fact that Trump did sign a travel ban that resulted in visa and green card holders from seven predominantly-Muslim countries being stopped and deported at airports, and that he has vowed to build a new wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. But the site, which describes itself as \u201claughing AT politicians not WITH them\u201d also posted articles with headlines like, \u201cMike Pence Bounds Into The Vice-President\u2019s Office With Manifest Of Vaginae To Register And Regulate\u201d and \u201cReport: Trump To Officially Declare February \u2018All Months Matter\u2019 Month,\u201d which are clearly satire.

    "claim": "Hillary Clinton's popular vote win in the presidential election came entirely from the state of California.",
    "content": " On 18 December 2016, the Federalist Papers, a conservative clickbait web site, posted a story headlined \u201cHillary\u2019s Popular Vote Win Came ENTIRELY from California\u201d: If the election was decided by the popular vote, than we would be swearing in a President Hillary Clinton. But that\u2019s not how it works. And \u2014 as he has said many time \u2014 if Donald Trump was campaigning for the popular vote, rather than the electoral vote, he would have campaigned much differently. But he didn\u2019t and Hillary\u2019s margin of victory in that state was 4.3 million votes \u2014 or 61.5 percent And therein lies the rub. The purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent regional candidates from dominating national elections\u2026 If you take California out of the total, Donald Trump won the popular vote by 1.4 million. As the web site pointed out, as of 19 December 2016 CNN had Hillary Clinton winning a popular vote margin over Donald Trump with totals of 65,788,583 to 62,955,363 respectively, a margin of approximately 2.8 million votes (although Trump won the presidency by securing 306 electoral college votes, 36 more than he needed to claim victory). It\u2019s true that if California\u2019s vote totals were entirely removed from the equation then Hillary Clinton would lose her popular vote lead, but the logic of that assessment is somewhat flawed. One could, for example, arbitrarily remove the states of New York and Massachusetts from the vote count, docking Clinton roughly 2.6 million votes (and wiping out her popular vote win). Or one could similarly claim that Trump\u2019s electoral vote victory \u201ccame entirely from Texas,\u201d since if Clinton had taken the Lone Star state (and its 38 electoral votes), she would also have won the overall election. One could combine any number of states\u2019 vote counts and exclude them from the aggregate, but doing so wouldn\u2019t undo the basic mathematical principle that a vote difference in one state can\u2019t sway the election results to or from a candidate who doesn\u2019t also have significant support from multiple other states. In this case, California wouldn\u2019t have put Clinton over the top in the popular vote total without the additional 61.4 million votes she received in other states. There is some validity to pointing out that the 2016 election is an exemplar of a modern trend that generally sees Democratic candidates tending to receive large numbers of votes from densely-populated metropolitan areas in states such as New York and California, while Republican candidates tend to collect votes from geographically larger but less populated portions of the country \u2014 one of the main factors behind this election\u2019s disparity between the popular vote (which Clinton won) and the electoral vote that actually decides the election (which Trump won). This phenomenon could be viewed as a positive, that our electoral system requires winning presidential candidates to have broad national support and not just rack up huge margins in a relatively small number of high-population centers. On the other hand, some argue that our government should represent people and not geography, and therefore the location of voters should be irrelevant. It may also be true, as Donald Trump has claimed, that without our winner-take-all electoral system (under which it makes no difference whether a candidate loses a state by 100 votes or 10,000,000 votes) that generally forces candidates to focus their efforts on a handful of \u201cswing\u201d states, he might have campaigned differently and garnered more popular votes than Hillary Clinton did. But freed from those electoral constraints, Clinton might also have campaigned differently and won more popular votes than she actually did \u2014 all such imaginings are just speculation that cannot be proved one way or the other. In any case, it is true that the margin of votes by which Hillary Clinton won the state of California was significantly greater than the margin by which she won the national popular vote. But even if Clinton\u2019s 4.3 million vote victory over Trump in California provided her overall winning edge, it wouldn\u2019t be an issue if she hadn\u2019t also amassed enough votes all the other states to make that outcome possible.

    "claim": "Voting in the 2020 presidential election took place after polls closed.",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. In mid-November 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2018s reelection campaign sent emails to solicit donations from supporters and made various claims without evidence that widespread voter fraud had corrupted the election\u2019s outcome. One rumor in particular claimed Americans had cast ballots after polls closed on Nov. 3 and that states included those votes in results that projected Democrat Joe Biden the country\u2019s 46th president. (Read more fact checks like this one here.) \u201cVotes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!\u201d the Trump campaign claimed in a Nov. 9 email obtained by Snopes.  Another fundraising email on Nov. 20 stated, \u201cVoting reportedly took place after the Election was over.\u201d         Together, the emails claimed \u2014 without showing evidence \u2014 that an unknown number of people submitted ballots in the presidential election between Biden and Trump after state-mandated deadlines, and that election officials considered those votes valid. First, let\u2019s unpack the logistics of U.S. presidential elections. All states require voters to be U.S. citizens, over age 18, and meet certain residency requirements to legally vote \u2014 no matter if they fill out ballots in-person at polling sites or vote by mail. But every state has its own set of laws governing when and how eligible residents can vote. Those different types of ballot-casting systems were at the heart of the Trump campaign\u2019s claim about voting deadlines.  State laws prescribe when polling places open and close on Election Day. Per the National Conference of State Legislature\u2019s compilation of those varying deadlines, the earliest sites open at 6 a.m. (in locations\u2019 respective time zones) and most close about 14 hours later. That means if you\u2019re a voter on the East Coast, polling shuts down roughly six hours before sites close in Alaska and Hawaii. Additionally, people who are still waiting in long lines to cast their vote when polls close may still vote if they remain in line. \u201cIf you leave the line, you may not be able to vote,\u201d says Vote.org, a nonpartisan voter-rights website. There was no proof of poll workers breaking those laws to allow voters to submit ballots for Biden or Trump in the late hours of Nov. 3 or afterwards. But here\u2019s what was key: Not everyone votes for president in person at the polls on Election Day. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic forced states to expand vote-by-mail systems to avoid spreading the virus at polls \u2014 resulting in a record number of mail-in ballots \u2014 every state allowed certain voters to cast ballots by mail, otherwise known as absentee voting, if those people requested the alternative before Election Day. Also, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, and Utah allowed all registered voters to cast ballots entirely by mail before 2020, while laws in more than a dozen other states permitted local jurisdictions to run elections completely by mail under certain conditions.        Let us circle back to voting logistics. While state laws govern all types of voting, those statutes in most states grant counties the authority to administer elections via a board of electors, an election official or officials, or both. As a result, thousands of local jurisdictions \u2014 not politicians in Washington, D.C, or governors \u2014 oversee the process of reviewing and counting ballots at polls. In other words, local governments are responsible for training poll workers to correctly remove mail-in ballots from their envelopes, check to see if voters\u2019 signatures are valid, and then feed papers with voters\u2019 selections into voting tabulation machines. At least 33 states allow poll workers to start doing some of that work one week, or more, before Election Day, according to NCSL. That means people who mailed ballots in the days or weeks before Nov. 3 in the Trump-Biden race may have had their paperwork processed before in-person polling started. See Pew Research Center\u2019s map of processing laws for mail-in ballots below.  On the flip side, laws in six states, including the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, do not allow poll workers to begin processing ballots until Election Day. Nonetheless, no state begins publishing unofficial voter tallies until physical polling ends, regardless of rules governing when mail-in ballot processing can begin. At that point, statisticians compare the sum of votes processed and counted to the difference in totals between the losing and winning candidate, all on a state-by-state basis. When there appears to be no mathematical possibility for a losing candidate to overcome the competitor in a state, a winner is projected there. But those calls do not signify the end of ballot processing and vote counting \u2014 even though the remaining votes would not shift the election\u2019s outcome. In 22 states and the District of Columbia, poll workers are legally required to count all valid ballots that were postmarked by Election Day, or a few days before, per Pew Research.        As a result, ballots that did not reach polling sites for processing on Nov. 3 \u2014 but showed an official postal marking for that date \u2014 were just as valid as ballots cast in-person on Election Day, under those states\u2019 laws. There was no evidence of any state or county breaking those laws governing postmark deadlines in the 2020 presidential election to undermine Trump. After local jurisdictions count all ballots in the days, or weeks, after Election Day, local election boards certify the results \u2014 making the voter tallies official. (See our investigation here into claims that that voter certification process allowed an opportunity for Trump to defy the outcome of the popular vote.) Then, state executive authorities seal state\u2019s results via a \u201cCertificate of Ascertainment,\u201d and electors cast votes for president via the Electoral College. We should note here: The emails from Trump\u2019s campaign alleging voting crimes asked supporters to chip in to a so-called \u201cOfficial Election Defense Fund\u201d or \u201cElection Defense Task Force,\u201d both of which the campaign framed as costly initiatives involving ballot recounts or various lawsuits to challenge Biden\u2019s win. But according to Brendan Fischer, director of the federal reform program at Campaign Legal Center, the average donor\u2019s money was not covering those expenses. \u201cSmall donors who give to Trump thinking they are financing an \u2018official election defense fund\u2019 are in fact helping pay down the Trump campaign\u2019s debt or funding his post-presidential political operation,\u201d Fischer tweeted. In sum, because there was no evidence to show poll workers illegally counted votes for Trump or Biden after polls closed on Election Day, nor after the postmarking deadlines had passed, we rate this claim \u201cMostly false.\u201d  "

    "claim": "On Nov. 10, 2020, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said \"there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration.\" ",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. As U.S. President Donald Trump and his allies attacked the integrity of the 2020 election \u2014 a misinformation campaign that culminated with an unprecedented effort to block President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s transition into the White House \u2014 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made himself available to reporters for a news conference on Nov. 10. There, viewers alleged, Pompeo, who is one of Trump\u2019s most loyal Cabinet members, made a point to defy results of the popular vote showing Biden as America\u2019s 46th president, and promised that \u201cthere will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration.\u201d The alleged comment would mean America\u2019s top diplomat publicly denied the outcome of the presidential election, despite the fact that his department advocates for free and fair elections abroad. Simultaneously, by confidently stating Trump would have another term, he undermined a key argument made by Trump and his supporters: The elections process was ongoing due to court litigation and the electoral process, making it unclear whether Trump or Biden would assume the White House on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 2021. (We explain the Electoral College and the process for certifying ballots after news media declare winners in presidential races here.)          According to C-SPAN footage of the press briefing (displayed below) as well as a transcript by the White House, Pompeo opened the event by promoting the government\u2019s activities in several foreign countries without mentioning the U.S. presidential election. Then, a reporter asked: \u201cIs the state department currently preparing to engage with the Biden transition team, and, if not, at what point does a delay hamper smooth transition or pose a risk to national security?\u201d Pompeo responded: There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration. Right? We\u2019re ready. The world is watching what\u2019s taking place here. We\u2019re going to count all of the votes. When the process is complete, there will be electors selected. There\u2019s a process \u2014 the Constitution lays it out pretty clearly. The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure the state department is functional today, successful today, and successful with a president who\u2019s in office on January 20, a minute after noon, will also be successful. I went through a transition on the front end, and I\u2019ve been on the other side of this; I\u2019m very confident that we will do all the things that are necessary to make sure that the government, the United States\u2019 government, will continue to perform its national security function as we go forward.      In other words, it was accurate to claim Pompeo said \u201cthere will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,\u201d despite the fact that voters picked Biden as the 46th president. Hours later, Pompeo said in a Fox News interview with host Bret Baier that the state department would be prepared come January, no matter who was in the White House. Per video footage of the interview (displayed below below) and a White House transcript, that exchange unfolded like this: Baier: You were asked today about the concerns about a smooth transition, and you said it will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration. Were you being serious there? Pompeo: We\u2019ll have a smooth transition, and we\u2019ll see what the people ultimately decided when all the votes have been cast. We have a process, Bret. The Constitution lays out how electors vote. It\u2019s a very detailed process laid out. We need to comply with all of that. And then I am very confident that we will have a good transition, that we will make sure that whoever is in office on noon on January 20th has all the tools readily available so that we don\u2019t skip a beat with the capacity to keep Americans safe. That\u2019s what I was speaking to today. I think it\u2019s important for not only the American people but the whole world, especially our adversaries, to know that we will achieve this in a way that\u2019s deeply consistent with the American tradition and keeps us all safe here at home. In short, he did not answer whether he \u201cwas being serious\u201d about promising a smooth transition to a second Trump administration, nor did he use Baier\u2019s question as an opportunity to explicitly correct his remark at the press conference. Additionally, he did not mention the Republican president by name in the Fox News interview, and said the department was a ready for a \u201cgood transition\u201d with \u201cwhoever is in office on noon on January 20.\u201d     In sum, considering video evidence and transcripts of Pompeo\u2019s remark at the Nov. 10 press conference \u2014 as well as the fact he said afterwards the department would be ready for \u201cwhoever is in office\u201d on Inauguration Day \u2014 we deem this claim mostly accurate.

    "claim": "The Trump administration's approval of the presidential transition process means Trump has conceded the 2020 election to Joe Biden.",
    "content": " Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. On Nov. 23, 2020, U.S. General Services Administrator Emily Murphy \u2014 an appointee of President Donald Trump \u2014 wrote a letter to President-elect Joe Biden that allowed him to start a formal transition of power. The paperwork, obtained by Snopes and displayed below, was the first formal recognition by Trump\u2019s government of a Biden presidency. The document from the head of the General Services Administration (GSA), an executive branch agency that oversees presidential transitions, raised questions about whether it meant that Trump himself acknowledged defeat to Biden. Concession statements to Americans or phone calls to winning candidates represent an informal step in the country\u2019s election process that typically occurs when one candidate secures the majority of electoral votes. Biden reached that milestone \u2014 winning key battleground states, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, by comfortable margins \u2014 weeks before Murphy\u2019s letter. However, Trump broke democratic norms by refusing to concede publicly.          Instead, the president\u2019s campaign filed a barrage of lawsuits in local jurisdictions across the country and accelerated a misinformation campaign online that denied or falsely presented the election results. While legal experts said the litigation did not contain enough evidence to reverse Biden\u2019s win, Trump\u2019s supporters viewed the effort as a commendable, tough, not-going-to-back-down approach to electoral politics. \u201cIt is not a stain on our national honor for a candidate to refuse to concede when there are open and compelling disputes about an electoral outcome,\u201d read a Nov. 23 statement by supporters of the Conservative Action Project, an initiative founded by former Attorney General Edwin Meese III. Despite not receiving Trump\u2019s concession, Biden filled his Cabinet for the White House, addressing the country under the \u201cOffice of the President Elect,\u201d and states certified results of the popular vote in order to begin the process of voting for president through the Electoral College. Cue Murphy\u2019s letter on Nov. 23. The document carried out the government\u2019s obligation under the 1963 Presidential Transition Act to allow presidents-elect and their appointees, aids, and other staff \u2014 otherwise known as a transition team \u2014 to access millions of federal dollars and set up White House operations before swearing-in ceremonies that would take place the January after general elections.   Murphy submitted the paperwork after election officials in Michigan certified Biden\u2019s win there, and a conservative Republican judge in Pennsylvania shot down a Trump campaign lawsuit, The Associated Press reported. Murphy\u2019s letter said: [Because] of recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results, I have determined that you may access the post-election resources and services described in Section 3 of the Act upon request. The actual winner of the presidential election will be determined by the electoral process detailed in the Constitution.        So, in short, a member of the Trump administration, Murphy, filed paperwork to change Biden\u2019s official title in government systems to \u201capparent president-elect\u201d and, as a result, granted him new privileges that only someone with that job title in federal government gets. But it was a wrong interpretation of that procedural step to claim Trump had therefore conceded the 2020 presidential race. Let us note here: No constitutional mandate or federal law requires losing presidential candidates to acknowledge defeat in order for the election\u2019s processes to continue. Rather, concession speeches have been an informal tradition that often symbolized a losing candidate\u2019s willingness to help with a peaceful transition between presidencies.  The Associated Press reported: In recent days, senior Trump aides including chief of staff Mark Meadows and White House counsel Pat Cipollone had also encouraged him to allow the transition to begin, telling the president he didn\u2019t need to concede but could no longer justify withholding support to the Biden transition. [\u2026] Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the GSA action \u201cis probably the closest thing to a concession that President Trump could issue.\u2033 Even after Murphy\u2019s letter, the Trump campaign sent supporters emails promoting false claims about the election outcome to solicit donations, including messages to sell \u201cCOUNT ALL LEGAL VOTES\u201d T-shirts.  Additionally, on Twitter the president said: \u201cRemember the GSA has been terrific, and Emily Murphy has done a great job, but the GSA does not determine who the next President of the United States will be.\u201d         The tweet accurately suggested that presidential elections are technically unfinished until the Electoral College casts its votes and Congress certifies that count, no matter what the administrator does or says. However, it was a misinterpretation of the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes, and state statutes to regard those post-Election Day procedures \u2014 steps that officially cement Americans\u2019 pick for president \u2014 as an opportunity to defy the will of the voters without providing compelling evidence of error or fraud. Hours after that tweet, Trump called reporters to a White House briefing room. He gave one-minute remarks about the economy and exited the room without taking questions from reporters. As he walked out, journalists shouted questions about his lack of a concession, and the president did not acknowledge them, White House footage of the event showed. In short, while a government agency under Trump\u2019s administration for the first time officially acknowledged Biden the \u201capparent president-elect\u201d in a letter that grants him access to federal assets before his swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20, 2021, it is false to claim that Trump had conceded defeat to the president-elect.
