    "content": " In October 2020, an image started circulating on social media that supposedly showed a new flavor of Oreo cookies: crab cake.   These Crab Cake Oreos (complete with tartar sauce cream filling) are not a genuine flavor of Oreo cookies. This image was created by a social media users with a penchant for producing fake (and, one might argue, disgusting) products.  This image was originally posted to the @Hollow.Foods Instagram page in May 2020. This Instagram page writes in its bio that it creates products for the \u201cworlds worst grocery store.\u201d So far, Hollow.Foods has imagined ill-advised products such as toothpaste-flavored ice cream bars called Cresticles, cobweb filled \u201cspooky\u201d Hot Pockets, spam-flavored Pop Tarts, a \u201cpresidential\u201d orange soda, and a ham water scented candle. This page has also produced a second fictional Oreo flavor: Buffalo chicken wings. While the origins of this image make it pretty clear that these Crab Cake Oreos are a fake product, we sheepishly reached out to Mondelez International, the company that manufacturers Oreo cookies, for confirmation.  A spokesperson told us: \u201cI can confirm that this is not a real OREO cookie flavor.\u201d While these Crab Cake Oreos are not real, there have been some interesting Oreo cookie flavors released over the years, such as lemon, pistachio, carrot cake, and mint.

    "content": " A warning about \u201cgovernment testing on DNA\u201d that has produced giant mutant spiders \u201cin a laboratory in Missouri\u201d hit social media in September 2014:  RIGHT HERE IN MO ! SPIDERS HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM A DNA LABORATORY LOCATED NEAR THE WOLF SANCTUARY ON ANTIRE RD ! Government testing on DNA has produced these spiders in a Laboratory in Missouri. Unfortunately they have been located off Lewis Rd just west of laboratory and seem to be breading in the wild much faster than when captive. Government officials are doing all they can to try to eliminate these spiders but can offer no guarantees. They could be popping up in surrounding neighborhoods west of the siting (Eureka, Pacific, Union, and St. Clair) within weeks. What we have in our favor is that winter is approaching and hope to slow down the migration no further than St. Clair before the cold hits. If you see these stay indoors and call the local police. They have been informed on procedures of capture and contact of the local governing agency.   Although the accompanying images may be real, they aren\u2019t pictures of giant spiders, or of any other form of arachnid (mutant or otherwise).   What\u2019s shown here is the Birgus latro, otherwise known as a coconut crab (or robber crab, ganjo crab, and palm thief).  A species of hermit crab, the coconut crab (so named because their claws are powerful enough to enable them to crack open and eat coconuts, and they will reportedly climb trees to pick coconuts when none are more readily available) is the world\u2019s largest terrestrial arthropod and can grow to achieve a leg span of up to three feet:  The coconut crab (Birgus latro) is a type of land hermit crab with a spectacular appearance and intriguing biology. Able to grow to relatively gigantic proportions, the coconut crab is probably the largest terrestrial arthropod in the world. Indeed, Charles Darwin described the coconut crab as \u201cmonstruous\u201d when he encountered it on the Keeling Islands during the voyage of the Beagle. Unlike most other hermit crabs, only the very small coconut crab juveniles find and use gastropod shells to protect their soft-skinned abdomen as they develop. Larger juveniles abandon the shell-carrying habit and instead their abdomen develops a hard skin, the exoskeleton, as over the rest of the body. This protects the crab, reduces water loss and does not restrict its growth, allowing it to reach up to a metre in size toe-to-toe. This huge crustacean is well adapted to life on land with long strong legs. It also has large muscular claws which are used for husking coconuts and opening the shell to eat the flesh. This is a unique behaviour amongst crabs and explains why this species is called the coconut crab. The claws are in fact so powerful they can lift objects such as vegetation or rocks weighing up to 28 kilograms. Its stalked eyes are red and this crab\u2019s body colour varies between islands from purplish-blue to orange-red. Studies show that male coconut crabs are considerably larger than females.   As noted in a December 2013 Wired feature on the coconut crab, this arthropod takes a very long time to grow to its full size, its natural habitat is tropical climes far from the Midwestern state of Missouri, and the species is being threatened by human encroachment:  Also known as the robber crab due to its curious propensity for stealing silverware and pots and pans, it\u2019s the 9-pound hermit crab PetSmart wouldn\u2019t dare carry, no matter how conveniently hypoallergenic it is. The coconut crab is endemic to a variety of islands in the Pacific and Indian oceans, though its populations are extremely threatened on some of these thanks to, you guessed it, human tomfoolery. It grows remarkably slowly, taking perhaps 120 years to reach full size, said ecologist Michelle Drew of the Max Planck Institute. As an arthropod, the coconut crab wears its skeleton on the outside and must shed it as it grows, so once a year it crawls into the safety of a burrow and molts. It\u2019s highly vulnerable once it steps out of this rigid shell, so to hasten the development of new armor it \u2026 consumes its old exoskeleton. Feeding this incredible growth is no small task, so the coconut crab eats anything it can get its claws on. It\u2019ll go after fruit, vegetation, and carrion: dead birds and other coconut crabs and such. It has been observed hunting other crabs, and Drew has records of them ambushing young chickens. But what it really loves are, of course, coconuts. Coconuts are extremely difficult to open. But as you may have noticed, the coconut crab is equipped with massive pincers. (One of Drew\u2019s friends had one clamp down on his thumb, which lost feeling for three months. She stresses, though, that the coconut crab is in fact quite gentle unless threatened.) \u201cThey use their claws to pull away the outer fibers,\u201d said Drew. \u201cThis can sometimes take many days and it often involves a number of crabs. They then use their longest walking leg to puncture a hole through the eyes of the coconut and then they can use their claws to pry open the shell further.\u201d Despite its freakish size, massive pincers and formidable armor, the coconut crab increasingly finds itself in peril. They have for millions of years lived on islands with no large mammalian predators, allowing them to reach such incredible proportions. This is changing as human encroachment has thrown their food chains into chaos.  "

    "claim": "Nabisco closed their Chicago plant and moved all production of Oreos to Mexico.",
    "content": " -->On 21 August 2015 (and on multiple subsequent occasions), Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told crowds of supporters at a campaign rally that he\u2019d sworn off Oreo cookies because the brand\u2019s maker, Nabisco, had closed their plant in Chicago and moved production of the snack product to Mexico: You know Mexico is the new China. The other day Nabisco, Nabisco \u2026 Oreos right, Oreos. I love Oreos, I\u2019ll never eat them again. Kay? Never eat \u2019em again. Nabisco closes a plant, they just announced a couple days ago, in Chicago and they\u2019re moving the plant to Mexico. Now why? Why? Why? Trump\u2019s claim echoed off-the-cuff remarks he had made earlier at non-campaign events (such as while reporting for jury duty in August 2015):   Donald Trump has pledged never to let another Oreo pass his lips. \u201cI\u2019m not eating any more Oreos,\u201d he promised on Monday afternoon. He made the declaration while speaking with reporters in the back of the jury assembly room at Manhattan Supreme Court. He was waiting to learn if he would be picked to serve on a panel, and he passed the time chatting about a wide range of subjects. That included the recent decision by Mondelez International, the parent of Nabisco, to move some of its Chicago operations to Mexico. He said the move would cost 2,000 American jobs. The number of purportedly lost jobs attached to the Oreo plant move has fluctuated from telling to telling. For example, on 14 August 2014 a Politico reporter tweeted:  Trump: \"Nabisco is taking 1,200 jobs from Chicago and moving them to Mexico. No more Oreos. They make Oreos don't they? I don't like them.\" \u2014 Roger Simon (@politicoroger) August 14, 2015          The repetition of Trump\u2019s claim had a clear impact on American consumers: the official Facebook pages of both Nabisco and Oreo were flooded with angry comments from users similarly denouncing the cookie- and cracker-maker over the purported loss of American jobs to Mexico: EVERY single one of your products posted above i have purchased. I have 12 grandchildren and baskets and stockings have been filled with many of these for them. Plus they are always in \u201cthe treat bowl\u201d. Guess What? NOT ANY MORE!!!! I really hope that Mexico can keep you in business because I will no longer spend one more penny on ANY of your products. Examples:   [Collected via e-mail and Twitter, September 2015] Someone posted a page on facebook saying Oreos are now being made in Mexico. Is this true and if so when did that happen?  Sad face, I will not be eating @Oreo as I just learned they outsourced their creation to Mexico. It's a sad day! #shameonoreos \u2014 Jason Isaacson (@JDIsaacson) September 23, 2015   @HydroxCookie where are you're cookies made? Oreo moved to Mexico. Made in USA wins my business. \u2014 Membery (@membery137) September 23, 2015   The spotlight pointed by Trump at Nabisco and Oreo lifted the story from the low-profile realm of business news, where it had previously lingered unnoticed. A 29 July 2015 Chicago Tribune article reported that 600 of 1,200 positions at the plant in question were on the chopping block following a decision announced by Nabisco\u2019s parent company, Mondelez International: Mondelez International will lay off half of its 1,200 employees in its bakery on Chicago\u2019s Southwest Side after deciding to make a major investment in a Mexico plant rather than its long-standing facility here. The company decided not to make a $130 million upgrade to the facility, the company\u2019s largest U.S. bakery, which dates to the 1950s, because the three unions that represent workers either did not make a proposal to keep the work or their concession packages were inadequate, said Laurie Guzzinati, a Mondelez spokeswoman. The new production lines will make some of Nabisco\u2019s most popular products, including Oreo, Ritz and Grahams. Mondelez International also announced the decision in a 29 July 2015 press release that confirmed much of the brand\u2019s production would remain in the United States: [An] investment in [upgraded equipment] will be completed by mid-2016 and will replace nine older, inefficient manufacturing lines at its Chicago biscuit plant. Today\u2019s announcement builds on the company\u2019s earlier manufacturing investments of more than $170 million in manufacturing lines at its U.S. biscuit plants in Fair Lawn, N.J., Naperville, Ill. and Richmond, Va., as well as additional investments in recent years in technologies and capabilities within its North American supply chain. Today\u2019s announcement follows a process that began in early April, involving discussions with employees\u2019 union representatives from the Chicago plant as well as company due diligence to select between Salinas and Chicago, the two locations which were considered for this investment. \u201cThe Chicago plant has been and will continue to be an important part of the company\u2019s North American biscuit footprint, producing a variety of beloved consumer products,\u201d said Olivier Bouret, Vice President, North America Integrated Supply Chain, Biscuits. \u201cWhile the new investment will affect approximately 600 positions in Chicago, we\u2019re committed to treating all impacted employees fairly through this difficult time.\u201d On 18 September 2015, a representative for Mondelez International disputed a number of Trump\u2019s assertions about Oreos in an e-mail to a news outlet: A representative for Mondel\u0113z Global LLC,  said Trump\u2019s statements about the company are untrue. \u201cWe announced in July a new investment in our supply chain in an already-existing facility we have in Mexico. We are NOT closing our facility in Chicago,\u201d wrote Laurie M. Guzzinati, senior director for corporate and government affairs in North America for Mondel\u0113z Global LLC. \u201cThough there will be an impact to some positions in Chicago, given that the investment is being made in a different facility in our manufacturing network, our Chicago bakery will continue to be an important site within the North American biscuit manufacturing network,\u201d Guzzinati wrote in an email to Foster\u2019s. Guzzinati said that the Chicago bakery produces a variety of Nabisco cookies and crackers, and will remain important due to its geographical location. \u201cThe Chicago bakery will remain one of the largest plants within the network from an overall head-count perspective,\u201d she said. Guzzinati added that Oreos are made in several manufacturing sites within the United States, including Fair Lawn, N.J., Richmond, Va. and Portland, Ore. So while it\u2019s true that Nabisco\u2019s parent company announced the elimination of some jobs at a Chicago plant, the number of jobs affected was 600 (not 1,200 or 2,000), and the facility was not closed. The company concurrently invested the expansion of manufacturing plants in three states, and Oreos remain in production in the U.S. at facilities in New Jersey, Oregon, and Virginia. "

    "claim": "An aerial photograph shows a giant 50-foot crab off the coast of Whitstable, UK.",
    "content": " A photograph of a giant 50-foot crab, dubbed Crabzilla, went viral after it was published in the UK newspaper Sunday Express on 12 October 2014. The aerial photograph of Crabzilla was originally posted to Weird Whitstable, a website dedicated to strange sightings in the Kent area, back in 2013. The blog posted a second photo of crabzilla in July 2014 which showed two enormous crab claws reaching out of the water: This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend. The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passersby shouted to them, the crab slipped silently away under the water, into the dark, sideways.  Quinton Winter, the curator of Weird Whitstable, told the Express Times that he was skeptical about the photos when he first saw them. That changed last summer, however, when he spotted the giant crab for himself: At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, \u2018that\u2019s a funny looking bit of driftwood.\u2019 It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws. Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.         Despite Winter\u2019s claim, the Crabzilla photo is just the result of some digital fakery. According to the Marine Biological Association of the UK, the Japanese spider crab is the largest crab species in the world. These crabs can grow up to 3.7 meters across, which, while incredibly large for a crab, is about 11.5 meters (37 feet) smaller than the estimated size of Crabzilla: The crab in the viral photo appears to be a cancer pagurus, which is commonly known as a brown or edible crab. These crabs are common in the Whitstable area, but they only grow to about 10 inches wide. Graphic artist Ashley Austen told Kent Online that someone probably used Photoshop and a brown crab image to create the Crabzilla photo: The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop. All the \u2018artist\u2019 had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbour and apply a few filters to it to get the realistic look. Indeed, the photo of Crabzilla is just that: merely an overhead photo of Whitstable from Bing Maps onto which someone grafted an image of a seemingly monstrous crab. Quinton Winter later said of the Crabzilla photo he published: \u201cWhen I saw the picture I thought I could use it in my exhibition. \u201cI thought it may have been a sand formation but it looked like a crab to me. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to lie about anything, it\u2019s just a bit of fun.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone seriously believes there actually is a 50ft crab in Whitstable. What would it feast on? Fat, juicy Londoners?\u201d "

When buying crabs in the market look for injection marks such as these when buying crabs imported from China. Chinese inject the crabs with formulin to keep them fresh but it is a highly toxic substance. I heard this today at a Thai market.   The message caused significant concern among social media users about whether imported crabs may truly be contaminated with formalin (or formulin), a dangerous formaldehyde solution. Immediately, the message bore one red flag of an urban legend: a source of \u201cI heard this at a market.\u201d And the original poster did not claim to have snapped the photographs himself; he only said that he jad learned of the purported practice during a 19 May 2015 visit to a market in Thailand. (The precise origin of the photographs wasn\u2019t explained.) As it turns out, the images in question had been circulated before and were not originally labeled as crabs injected with formalin. English-language blog posts from December 2014 and May 2015 (as well as Chinese-language versions of indeterminate date) all labeled the same set of images as showing adulterated crabs, but in those versions the crabs in question were injected not with preservatives to stretch their shelf lives, but rather with seawater to increase their per-pound weights:  Be careful when you buy crab at this time because there are reliable reports that there is a pinhole in the abdomen because the crabs have injected feared and pricked with water to preserve freshness and increase the weight of the crab. Hi all sorts of techniques now want to deceive you!  Note that even in the text quoted above, the claims of weight tampering still came to the poster via unspecified \u201creliable reports\u201d and not via any documented evidence or first-hand knowledge of such a practice. While that posited claim was likelier than the one involving formalin, it also lacked any corroborating information to support it. The latter claim elaborated upon some of the drawbacks of adulterated crab:  The needle crab buy a home, take a cooking pot, when you want to enjoy delicious crab open, there will be many special salty seawater flowing, up to half of the plate so much out of the whole crab or crab cream has been the sea soak for too long, the steam to a simmer, already become yellow soup.  It\u2019s true the United States imports some crab from Asia, and scattered reports in 2011, 2012 and 2014 have claimed the sighting of of meats and other foods intentionally contaminated with formalin in Bangladesh and Indonesia.  We could find no evidence that crab in China is routinely adulterated in this fashion, however. "

Another prominent entry in this genre of marketing legends is the claim that instant cake mixes which required only the addition of water initially sold quite poorly because housewives felt \u201cguilty\u201d about contributing virtually nothing to the cake-making process \u2014 a stumbling block that was successfully overcome when one food company hit on the ingenious idea of eliminating dried eggs from its mix and instead requiring the addition of a fresh egg, thus assuaging homemakers\u2019 guilt by providing them with a greater sense of participatory investment in the results: Example:   [Tan, 1979] A food processing firm marketed a cake mix which required that the housewife add only water to produce a creamy batter and fine cake. The company could not understand why the mix would not sell, until special research revealed the public felt uneasy about a mix that required only water. It seemed too simple. They felt they themselves had to do something to a cake mix. So the company changed the formula and required the housewife to add an egg. Immediately, the mix achieved great success. Although there\u2019s a grain of truth to this claim, the legend that sprouted from it is a different kind of fruit: a marketing innovation did revive flagging sales of cake mixes, but it wasn\u2019t the innovation most people think it was.         First of all, the choice between offering \u201ccomplete\u201d cake mixes (i.e., mixes that included dried eggs, to which consumers added only water) or mixes that required the addition of fresh eggs was not an issue considered by food companies only when initial sales of instant cake mixes proved disappointing; it was a point of contention from the very beginning: When Pillsbury and the other big companies were working to develop their cake mixes in the 1940s, the question of whether or not to include dried eggs was a major in-house debate. Paul Gerot, the CEO at Pillsbury in this period, called it \u201cthe hottest controversy we had over the product,\u201d and he noted that even after the mixes made their debut, the arguing went on for years. It\u2019s also not the case that initial sales of cake mixes were disappointing: between 1947 (just before the major food companies introduced their cake mix products to the market) and 1953, sales of cake mixes doubled. The problem occurred several years later, when sales of cake mixes flattened between 1956 and 1960 (rising only 5 percent during that period). It was then that the major food companies sought to find out why more families weren\u2019t using cake mixes and brought about the circumstances that gave rise to the \u201cegg theory\u201d: Looking for reasons why so many women who could benefit from cake mixes seemed to be ignoring them \u2026 Ernest Dichter [came up with an] analysis in the course of a study he was carrying out for General Mills. After interviewing women and exploring the emotions that surrounded cakes and baking, Dichter reported that the very simplicity of mixes \u2014 just add water and stir \u2014 made women feel self-indulgent for using them. There wasn\u2019t enough work involved. In order to enjoy the emotional rewards of presenting a homemade cake, they had to be persuaded that they had really baked it, and such an illusion was impossible to maintain if they did virtually nothing. \u201cThis is typical of what the average housewife said: \u2018Yes, I\u2019m using a cake mix; it saves me a lot of trouble but I really shouldn\u2019t,'\u201d Dichter wrote later. His advice was to leave the homemaker something to do \u2014 for instance, add the eggs \u2014 whenever she made a cake from a mix. She would feel she had contributed something of herself, and the mindless nature of the task would no longer plague her. According to Dichter, his client \u2014 and, by implication, the other manufacturers \u2014 seized on this wisdom and promptly reformulated their mixes, leaving out the dried eggs. Women started adding their own fresh eggs, stopped feeling guilty, and cake mixes became a success. Over the years this story came to be a favorite among other consumer experts, who often rounded up more psychological studies to reinforce Dichter\u2019s analysis. The egg theory, with its emphasis on the homemaker\u2019s personal investment in the cake, set the tone for much subsequent advertising (\u201cYou and Ann Pillsbury can make a great team\u201d) and has been widely acknowledged as the insight that saved cake mixes. However, as Laura Shapiro observed in Something from the Oven: Reinventing Dinner in 1950s America, \u201cwhile Dichter\u2019s work was influential, its precise role in the success of the cake mix is unclear.\u201d For starters, although it may not have been a point articulated by the homemakers Dichter surveyed, the fact was that fresh eggs produced superior cakes. Using complete mixes which included dried eggs resulted in cakes that stuck to the pan, had poor texture, had a shorter shelf life, and often tasted too strongly of eggs. \u201cChances are,\u201d Shapiro wrote, \u201cif adding eggs persuaded some women to overcome their aversion to cake mixes, it was at least partly because fresh eggs made for better cakes.\u201d Furthermore, the two food companies who came to dominate the cake mix market in this era, General Mills and Pillsbury, adopted opposite approaches: the former chose to go with fresh-egg mixes, while Pillsbury opted to offer complete mixes. If the form of eggs used were truly the tipping point that saved the cake mix industry, then sales of one of these company\u2019s products should have tanked in comparison to the other\u2019s. The key marketing innovation that Dichter\u2019s analysis spurred was not the fresh-egg cake mix, but rather the repositioning of cakes as merely one element of a larger product, an overall creation that entailed a much greater degree of participation and creativity from homemakers and emphasized appearance over taste: Dichter rightly perceived the overwhelming weight of the moral and emotional imperative to bake cakes from scratch. His research spurred countless ads and magazine articles aimed at persuading women to differentiate between the plain cake layers \u2014 \u201cmerely step number one,\u201d according to Living \u2014 and the finished masterpiece. \u201cNow, success in cakemaking is packaged right along with the precision ingredients,\u201d Myrna Johnston assured readers of Better Homes &amp; Gardens in 1953. \u201cYou can put your effort into glorifying your cake with frosting, dreaming up an exciting trim that puts your own label on it.\u201d For modern women, these authorities proclaimed, the real art of baking began after the cake emerged from the oven. This perspective changed the nature of the traditional challenges facing home bakers. Flavor and texture were no longer at issue, and they had little importance anyway in a cake that was destined for a great deal of imaginative frosting. Cover a quick angel food cake with apricot glaze and icing, and surround it with ladyfingers cut to size, the experts suggested. Or split the cake, fill it with buttercream, border it with chocolate, and top it with chocolate-dipped cherries. Fill and frost layers of yellow cake with butterscotch pudding, dot the top with salted pecans, and call it a torte. Cover an oblong cake with chocolate frosting and sprinkle it with green decorating sugar \u2014 that\u2019s the football field. Use white frosting for the lines, and stick candy for the goalposts. A piece of banana covered with melted chocolate is the football. Cut a hole in the center of an angel food cake, fill it with partially jelled orange gelatin and canned peaches, frost the whole thing with whipped cream, and cover that with toasted coconut. McCall\u2019s gave directions for making a Humpty-Dumpty cake \u2014 there were thirteen steps to it, including making three different frostings, painting the cake with food coloring, and assembling the various parts with wooden skewers and drinking straws. It took about twelve hours, though much of the time was spent waiting for various layers to dry. The thirteen steps didn\u2019t include making the cake itself from two boxes of mix. A huge, lavishly frosted layer cake, opened up wide so the viewer could gaze at the tenderness inside, became the presiding image in cake iconography. Ads for flour and cake mix, as well as for baking powder, shortening, chocolate, and coconut invariably displayed a cake in this posture. Like models, whose mesmerizing inescapable faces define beauty in their time, these cakes set the standard for perfect festivity and made most others look humble by comparison. The standard itself was purely visual. Flavor would never count for much in an industrially produced cake, because simple sweetness was so easily achieved in the factory and so widely acceptable. But the distinguishing attributes of the iconic cake \u2014 its height and lightness \u2014 were just the qualities that technology could achieve with ease. What ultimately ensured the long-term success of instant cake mixes was a declining exposure to the art of cooking. From the 1950\u2019s onward, middle class girls tended to spend more time engaged in other pursuits outside the kitchen (especially after the advent of television), many home economics courses offered at schools started teaching students to bake with mixes rather than from scratch, and culinary knowledge and skills acquired by mothers and grandmothers stopped being passed along to successive generations. As fewer and fewer home cooks learned to recognize the difference between from-scratch cakes and mix cakes, the longevity of the latter was assured. "

    "claim": "Expired boxes of cake and pancake mix are dangerously toxic.",
    "content": " In April 2006, the experience of a 14-year-old who had eaten pancakes made from a mix that had gone moldy was described in the popular newspaper column Dear Abby. The account has since been circulated widely on the Internet as scores of concerned homemakers ponder the safety of the pancake and other baking mixes lurking in their larders: DEAR ABBY: I recently made a batch of pancakes for my healthy 14-year-old son, using a mix that was in our pantry. He said that they tasted \u201cfunny,\u201d but ate them anyway. About 10 minutes later, he began having difficulty breathing and his lips began turning purple. I gave him his allergy pill, had him sit on the sofa and told him to relax. He was wheezing while inhaling and exhaling. My husband, a volunteer firefighter and EMT, heated up some water, and we had my son lean over the water so the steam could clear his chest and sinuses. Soon, his breathing became more regular and his lips returned to a more normal color. We checked the date on the box of pancake mix and, to my dismay, found it was very outdated. As a reference librarian at an academic institution, I have the ability to search through many research databases. I did just that, and found an article the next day that mentioned a 19-year-old male DYING after eating pancakes made with outdated mix. Apparently, the mold that forms in old pancake mix can be toxic! When we told our friends about my son\u2019s close call, we were surprised at the number of people who mentioned that they should check their own pancake mix since they don\u2019t use it often, or they had purchased it some time ago. With so many people shopping at warehouse-type stores and buying large sizes of pancake mix, I hope your readers will take the time to check the expiration date on their boxes. \u2014 SUE IN WYANTSKILL, N.Y. DEAR SUE: Thank you for the warning. I certainly was not aware that pancake mix could turn moldy and cause an allergic reaction in someone with an allergy to mold \u2014 but it\u2019s logical. I wonder if the same holds true for cake mix, brownie mix and cookie mix. If so, then a warning should be placed on the box for people like me. We hear so often about discarding prescription and over-the-counter medications after their expiration dates, but I don\u2019t recall warnings about packaged items in the pantry. Heads up, folks!  With so many people scratching the bottom of the pocket and of course the pantry shelves\u2026. be aware of the warning given below! I always thought that \u201cold\u201d mixes that were past their expiration date would just not rise/bake correctly. This is scary! Somebody wrote: Before my surgery I bought quite a few Duncan Hines cakes mixes that were on sale. A couple of months ago I decide to use one, I checked the expiration date and found it past, all the boxes were passed the expiration date. I phoned Duncan Hinds to ask if the one that was only two months passed if it was OK. She told me in no uncertain words to throw them all out, she even said to open the boxes and throw the mix in the garbage, just in case someone picked it up and used it. Cake Mixes &amp; Toxins- **PLEASE READ** Pass this on to ALL in your address book. You never know whose life you may save by doing so. For those of you at work, PLEASE remember to check your cupboards when you get home tonight!!! A student at HBHS (high school) had pancakes this week and it almost became fatal. His Mom (registered nurse) made him pancakes, dropped him off at school and headed to play tennis. She never takes her cell phone on the court but did this time and her son called to say he was having trouble breathing. She told him to go to the nurse immediately and proceeded to call school and alert the nurse. The nurse called the paramedics and they were there in 3 minutes and worked on the boy all the way to the hospital. He came so close to dying. Evidently this is more common then I ever knew. Check the expiration dates on packages like pancakes and cake mixes that have yeast which over time develop spores. Apparently, the mold that forms in old mixes can be toxic! Throw away ALL OUTDATED pancake mix, brownie mixes, Bisquick, cake &amp; cookie mixes, etc., you have in your home. P.S. Tell this to your children, grandchildren, nephews, nieces and anyone else who keeps these types of mixes in the cupboard. P.P.S. This warning especially applies to any person(s) with mold allergies. There is truth in this tale, yet its inherent warning is overblown. In a nutshell, staledated pancake and other baking mixes pose no danger to you unless:  You are allergic to mold The baking mix was not contained in an unbleached wax paper, plastic, or a foil pouch within its outer packaging  How old the mix is has no bearing on its safety \u2014 a mix that is well within its freshness date yet has come to contain mold spores could prove fatal to someone with a mold allergy, while one that is a year or two beyond its \u201cBest use by\u201d date but did not contain mold spores would be perfectly safe.         While we cannot vet the incident described by \u201cSue in Wyantskill\u201d involving her 14-year-old son, the underlying claim is demonstrably true \u2014 it is possible for someone who chows down on pancakes made from a mix that has sat around too long to suffer a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction to the molds that have grown therein. We know this to be so because it has happened before, and the resultant death was documented. In 2001, two pathologists practicing in Charleston, South Carolina, reported on an unnamed 19-year-old who died in such a manner. While home on vacation from college, the victim, a young man with a history of allergies (including mold), polished off two pancakes made from a packaged mix that had sat open in a kitchen cabinet for about two years \u2014 even though his two friends stopped eating their portions, complaining that the griddlecakes tasted like rubbing alcohol. Very quickly thereafter, while watching television, the ill-fated collegian experienced shortness of breath that was not relieved by his inhaler. He asked his friends to take him to a clinic not far from the home, and he was reported to have turned a bit blue from lack of oxygen (i.e., became cyanotic) during the ride. While he did manage to walk into the clinic on his own, once inside he suddenly collapsed in cardiopulmonary arrest. He failed to respond to resuscitative efforts and was pronounced dead. The cause of his death was determined to be anaphylaxis due to an allergic reaction to molds. Anaphylaxis is a rapidly developing immunologic reaction that occurs when those who have allergies come in contact with the substances they are allergic to. When it kills, it does so by triggering fatal respiratory or cardiac arrest. The pancake mix that delivered a toxic payload was analyzed and found to contain four rather nasty molds: Penicillium, Fusarium, Mucor, and Aspergillus. The decedent had not been allergic to eggs (which are a component of pancakes), so there was no doubt as to which allergy had killed him. It had been mold, and nothing but. There was a death, and it had been due to ancient pancake mix. Or, rather, to an allergic reaction to the mold that had grown in the stale pancake mix. It needs be kept in mind there is nothing inherently toxic about pancake mix that has passed its freshness date; the product\u2019s aging does not transform it into a poison, nor does the growth of mold within opened boxes of flapjack powder turn it into something that will fell all who ingest it. Only those who have allergies to mold are at risk, and even then, for the pancake mix to pose a hazard it has to contain mold spores, not just be over the hill. In October 2008 the pancake mix warning was expanded to include cake, biscuit, and brownie mixes. I am sure this would apply to all pkg. baking goods and cereals. A student at HBHS (high school) had pancakes this week and it almost became fatal. His Mom (registered nurse) made him pancakes, dropped him off at school and headed to play tennis. She never takes her cell phone on the court but did this time and her son called to say he was having trouble breathing. She told him to go to the nurse immediately and proceeded to call school and alert the nurse. The nurse called the paramedics and they were there in 3 minutes and worked on the boy all the way to the hospital. He came so close to dying. Evidently this is more common then I ever knew. Check the expiration dates on packages like pancakes and cake mixes that have yeast which over time develop spores. Apparently, the mold that forms in old mixes can be toxic! Throw away ALL OUTDATED pancake mix, Bisquick, brownie mixes etc you have in your home. P.S. You might want to tell this to your children, grandchildren, nephews, nieces and anyone else who keeps these types of mixes in the cupboard. Unlike what the e-mailed caution would have folks believe, there is nothing magical about yeast which causes it to \u201cover time develop spores.\u201d For mold to gain access to a food product, the foodstuff has to be exposed to its spores. Pancake mix cocooned in an unbleached wax paper, plastic, or a foil pouch within its outer packaging wouldn\u2019t have this contact and should still be safe no matter how old it gets. However, mix sold unpouched in cardboard boxes or paper sacks would likely be at risk even if the box or sack hadn\u2019t previously been opened, because such packaging would not necessarily keep dampness out, and mold thrives in damp environments. What does all this mean? If you don\u2019t have a mold allergy, you needn\u2019t fear your pancake mix; if you do have such a sensitivity, you shouldn\u2019t keep your flapjack makings around for a few years after opening the box or pouch it came in. It\u2019s not worth dying over 50\u00a2 worth of pancake mix, so when in doubt, throw it out. "
