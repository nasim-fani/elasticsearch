    "claim": "Dr. Anthony Fauci said there was \"nothing to worry about\" in late February 2020 in regards to COVID-19 and it was \"safe\" to do things like go to the movies and the gym.",
    "content": " As governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Read our coronavirus fact checks. Submit any questionable rumors and \u201cadvice\u201d you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.   In early April 2020, the Trump administration was facing strong criticism for its response to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. Against that backdrop, social media users shared posts critical of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the leaders of the administration\u2019s ongoing COVID-19 response. The posts accused Fauci of throwing U.S. President Donald Trump under the bus for a belated response to the growing public health crisis, while failing himself to adequately warn the American public of the looming disease threat. Social media posts by Trump\u2019s supporters highlighted an April 12, 2020, interview on CNN in which host Jake Tapper asked Fauci, \u201cDo you think lives could have been saved if social distancing, physical distancing, stay-at-home measures had started third week of February, instead of mid-March?\u201d To that question, Fauci gave the answer that earned him the ire of Trump\u2019s supporters: You know, Jake, again, it\u2019s the what would have, what could have. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to go back and say that. I mean, obviously, you could logically say, that if you had a process that was ongoing, and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives. Obviously, no one is going to deny that. But what goes into those kinds of decisions is \u2014 is complicated. But you\u2019re right. I mean, obviously, if we had, right from the very beginning, shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different. But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.         In rebuttal to this perceived criticism of the Trump administration, social media users accused Fauci of himself minimizing the threat in a Feb. 29 television interview. One such tweet, bearing the hashtag #FireFauci was retweeted by Trump on April 12, 2020, raising speculation that the president was preparing to fire the doctor.  Another tweet complained that Fauci had said it was \u201csafe\u201d to do things like go to the movies and the gym in early February and March but \u201cdropped Trump in the grease on CNN,\u201d or let the president take the blame. These criticisms ignore the context of Fauci\u2019s Feb. 29 commentary and the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 situation. On Feb. 29, Fauci gave an interview on the NBC morning talk show \u201cToday,\u201d during which he stated that at that moment in time, \u201cthe risk is still low, but this could change.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve said that many times even on this program,\u201d Fauci stated in that interview. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don\u2019t need to change anything you\u2019re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.\u201d The situation with COVID-19 in the United States was indeed drastically different on Feb. 29 than it was in mid-April.        On Feb. 29, news reports indicated there were 70 known cases in the U.S., and officials were reporting the first known death from the novel coronavirus on American soil. That day also saw the first few reports of \u201ccommunity spread,\u201d or transmission of the disease from an unknown source. Fauci did say on Feb. 29 that Americans did not need to change their routines for the time being, but he also noted that depending on how the COVID-19 outbreak played out, that could all change, and in the coming weeks, it did. Since that day, COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic, more than half a million cases have been reported in the United States, and the death toll has rapidly climbed past 20,000 with most of the American public under guidance to stay home in order to slow the spread of the virus. Fauci later clarified that in the April 12 interview, he was responding to a \u201chypothetical\u201d question about the administration\u2019s response but noted that his wording choice was \u201cpoor\u201d and that administration officials had in fact heeded his early recommendations about social distancing guidelines. Fauci also noted that his comments in a CNN interview were interpreted by some to mean that the Trump administration gave medical experts \u201cpush back\u201d that cost lives at the beginning of the outbreak. He acknowledged that his answer was not worded well and largely misconstrued. We therefore rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d "

    "claim": "An American Airlines pilot penned an essay about Muslims entitled \"You Worry Me.\"",
    "content": " The origins of \u201cYou Worry Me\u201d remain murky: it first  appeared on the Internet in June 2002, but our attempts to verify whether its real author is an American Airlines pilot and/or someone named John Maniscalco have so far led only to dead ends. According to the FAA Registry, John Maniscalco is indeed a real pilot, but this item was also printed in a less vitriolic form in the Hyattsville, Maryland, Gazette (under the title \u201cAn open letter to my Arab-Muslim neighbors\u201d) on 12 October 2001 and credited to a Kevin Daly of Beltsville. Newspaper publication of a piece as a letter to the editor is not a reliable indicator of true authorship, however, as demonstrated by another widely-circulated Internet piece about President Clinton that was printed in several different newspapers under the names of at least four different people. The Gazette letter might have been based on the Internet version, or the Internet version might be an altered transcription of the Gazette letter; John Maniscalco might have been the original author (or alterer), or he might have been someone whose name became attached to the piece simply because he forwarded it to others. Aside from the question of authorship, this is not an item that can be branded \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse,\u201d because it\u2019s merely someone\u2019s expression of his opinions. Thematically, it\u2019s a more overt expression of the feelings conveyed by such (apocryphal) September 11-related legends as the claim that no taxis were to be found around the World Trade Center the morning of the terrorist attacks: the fear and unease generated by the knowledge that the perpetrators were people who had been living among us undetected for months; people who, although they may have been foreigners, were not out of place amidst the cultural diversity of America. How, then, do we now distinguish friend from foe? Wouldn\u2019t it be so much easier if, as advocated in this essay, we could simply assume all ARAB-MUSLIMS to be guilty and demand them to demonstrate otherwise? But such an approach is not only inimical to many of the principles American stands for, it is also logically flawed. What terrorists bent on the destruction of the U.S. would hesitate to camouflage themselves by hypocritically waving American flags or professing a false love for America? We cannot judge people by outward appearances alone, and that realization leaves us feeling scared and powerless.       &nbsp;  Sources:   --> "

    "claim": "A 1922 New York Times article reported that Adolf Hitler \u201cwas merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers\u201d.",
    "content": " On 10 February 2015, the New York Times re-released the first article they ever published about Adolf Hitler, who was then the chairman of the Nazi party. The story, dated 21 November 1922 and republished in the Times\u2018 \u201cFirst Glimpses\u201d section, opened with this introduction: On Nov. 21, 1922, The New York Times gave its readers their first glimpse of Hitler, in a profile that got a lot of things right \u2014 its description of his ability to work a crowd into a fever pitch, ready then and there to stage a coup, presaged his unsuccessful beer hall putsch less than a year later. But the article also got one crucial point very wrong \u2014 despite what \u201cseveral reliable, well-informed sources\u201d told The Times in the third paragraph from the bottom, his anti-Semitism was every bit as genuine and violent as it sounded. This re-release was widely covered by other news outlets immediately after it was posted in 2015, with many of them suggesting or implying its description bore similarities to the political movement of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. An excerpt from that 1922 article reads as follows: But several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitler\u2019s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers and keep them aroused, enthusiastic, and in line for the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to be employed effectively for political purposes. A sophisticated politician credited Hitler with peculiar political cleverness for laying emphasis and over-emphasis on anti-Semitism, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t expect the masses to understand or appreciate your finer real aims. You must feed the masses with cruder morsels and ideas like anti-Semitism. It would be politically all wrong to tell them the truth about where you really are leading them.\u201d This story was published early in both Hitler\u2019s career and in the existence of the Nazi party itself, whose followers were then called \u2018Hakenkreuzler,\u2019 or \u2018swastika wavers.\u2019 In November 1922, when this article was first published, Hitler had been Nazi party chairman for just over a year, and it had been only three years since he had delivered his first public political speech. Hitler\u2019s failed attempt to overthrow the local government in Bavaria, known as the \u201cBeer Hall Putsch,\u201d was one year away. The Times reached out to Hitler for comment in 1922, which he declined, as described in the story: \u201cHerr Hitler regrets he is unable to meet you as he is leaving town on important business for several days,\u201d was the answer received by The New York Times correspondent. His important business was going to Regensburg with three special trainloads of Munich admirers for the purpose of holding a series of reactionary inflammatory meetings and incidentally to beat up protesting Socialists and Communists with blackjacks if any dare protest, which is becoming increasingly rarer.

    "claim": "A video shows Koko the gorilla spontaneously using sign language to issue a warning about climate change.",
    "content": " If you want an audience to take heed of what you have to say, sometimes the messenger who delivers it for you can be just as important as the message itself. Depending on the nature of your communiqu\u00e9, you may find it has a much greater impact on your intended audience if it is conveyed a a sympathetic figure who can tug at people\u2019s heartstrings (e.g., a child, a Native American, a mother, a veteran) or a respected figure whom viewers perceive as knowledgeable about the subject at hand (e.g., a judge, a policeman, a college professor). A messenger who brought both those qualities to the table was Koko the gorilla, a primate who purportedly understands approximately 2,000 words of the spoken human language and can communicate her thoughts to humans via her use of more than 1,000 signs of what \u2018Gorilla Sign Language\u2019 (a modified version of American Sign Language). In 2015 two non-profit organizations, the Gorilla Foundation (who oversee Koko\u2019s care and training), and NOE Conservation (who seek to safeguard biodiversity), teamed up to produce a Public Service Announcement (PSA) featuring Koko in conjunction with the United Nations Climate Change Conference (also known as the COP21 Climate Conference) held in Paris in December of that year:  That video captured Koko supposedly signing about the importance of our protecting and preserving nature, a message that (given the nature of the proceedings it was associated with) was interpreted as a plea to acknowledge the issue of climate change. The NOE said as much, declaring that the video captured \u201cKoko reacting after she has been informed about what is at stake at COP21.\u201d And the press release issued with the video by the Gorilla Foundation asserted that Koko was indeed being \u201cclear\u201d about wanting to convey the notion that \u201cMan is harming the Earth\u201d: Because of her unique ability to communicate with humans in sign language, Koko is a natural ambassador for endangered species, and thus we agreed to co-produce a short video PSA (Public Service Announcement) contingent on Koko\u2019s willingness to participate. Koko was clear about the main message: Man is harming the Earth and its many animal and plant species and needs to \u201churry\u201d and fix the problem.         We humans may disagree on the possibly deleterious effects our activities are having on our global environment, but how could we possibly ignore a poignant plea from a gorilla \u2014 a message delivered by a personification of Nature itself, who is not coincidentally regarded as sympathetic and knowledgeable regarding the subject at hand? Some viewers took the video a little too literally, however, and were surprised at Koko\u2019s pithy and timely exhortation to heed the perils of global warming. But nothing about the video indicates that Koko can actually entertain, much less communicate to humans, thoughts about environmentalism. For starters, as noted in a 2014 Slate, human-ape communication may be far more about anthropomorphization than actual linguistic expression, especially when it comes to the expressing ideas rather than communicating basic needs: [C]onceding that the scientific jury is still out on whether gorillas are capable of sophisticated emotions doesn\u2019t make headlines, and admitting the ambiguity inherent in interpreting a gorilla\u2019s sign language doesn\u2019t bring in millions of dollars in donations. So we get a story about Koko mourning Robin Williams: a nice, straightforward tale that warms the heart but leaves scientists and skeptics wondering how a gorilla\u2019s emotions can be deduced so easily. Koko is perhaps the most famous product of an ambitious field of research, one that sought from the outset to examine whether apes and humans could communicate. In dozens of studies, scientists raised apes with humans and attempted to teach them language. Dedicated researchers brought apes like Koko into their homes or turned their labs into home-like environments where people and apes could play together and try, often awkwardly, to understand each other. The researchers made these apes the center of their lives. But the research didn\u2019t deliver on its promise. No new studies have been launched in years, and the old ones are fizzling out. A behind-the-scenes look at what remains of this research today reveals a surprisingly dramatic world of lawsuits, mass resignations, and dysfunctional relationships between humans and apes. Unlike us, it seems that apes don\u2019t care to chitchat. Psychologist Susan Goldin-Meadow points out that studies with Kanzi (a bonobo) show that only 4 percent of his signs are commentary, meaning the other 96 percent are all functional signs, asking for food or toys. Similar skepticism about Koko emerged in the 1980s, when Herb Terrace published a fairly scathing critique of ape language research. Among other criticisms, Terrace asserted that Koko\u2019s signs were not spontaneous but instead elicited by [her handler\u2019s] asking her questions. In any case, Koko\u2019s supposed message about climate change and biodiversity is completely lacking in context: the viewer has no idea what any offscreen handlers might have said or done to elicit the signing she produces, or whether the video is anything more than a collection of disjoint, completely unrelated signs strung together into a narrative fashioned by humans rather than a gorilla. Even if we were to assume the (highly unlikely) possibility that Koko\u2019s signing was completely spontaneous and unguided, her \u201cmessage\u201d is highly ambiguous and non-specific \u2014 outside of humans\u2019 suggesting a framework for us to employ in interpreting it: I am gorilla. I am flowers, animals. I am nature. Man Koko love. Earth Koko love. But Man stupid. Stupid! Koko sorry. Koko cry. Time hurry! Fix Earth! Help Earth! Hurry! Protect Earth. Nature see you. Thank you. For all we know, this discourse might have been prompted by Koko\u2019s having just witnessed a clumsy gardener on a power mower carelessly amputating a crop of blooming roses in a nearby flowerbed, and she\u2019s expressing that she wants someone to repair the damage by reattaching the severed buds to their stems. Even the Gorilla Foundation admitted that Koko was \u201cbriefed\u201d on the subject at hand and provided with a \u201cscript\u201d for the video, which was \u201cedited from a number of separate takes\u201d: Turns out Koko was very interested in the subject [of preserving biodiversity], which we briefed her on via a recent issue of National Geographic titled \u201cCool It!\u201d We also presented her with a script drafted by NOE (as any celebrity ambassador asked to do a PSA would expect) and allowed her to improvise during s series of brief daily video discussion sessions, in which Koko also had to learn a few new signs, such as \u201cProtect\u201d and \u201cNature.\u201d The resulting PSA was edited from a number of separate takes, for brevity and continuity.        Barbara King, a biological anthropologist at the College of William and Mary who writes about human evolution, primate behavior, and the cognition and emotion of animals, commented on the the Koko PSA thusly for NPR: [R]eminds me of earlier attempts by the Gorilla Foundation to showcase Koko\u2019s ability to understand things that there\u2019s little chance she could understand, at least in the ways suggested. Anthropomorphism \u2014 the projection of so-called human qualities onto other animals \u2014 is not inevitably wrong. Other animals may share with us many ways of thinking and feeling, and recognizing that fact is often appropriate. But the anthropomorphism in this video is not appropriate. Not even linguistically inclined apes comprehend anything close to the dynamic interplay between humans and nature that underlies anthropogenic climate change. King also quoted Sherman Wilcox, professor of linguistics at the University of New Mexico, as saying in reaction to this video: This is obviously a doctored video composed of highly edited clips of single signs pieced together to make it look like Koko is actually saying something, when she\u2019s not. It is disconcerting on so many levels. I fear it diminishes the seriousness of the climate change issue. Climate change deniers already feel like scientists are lying to the public. We don\u2019t need to give them fake videos. A Huffington Post article on the topic similarly quoted skeptics from the fields of linguistics and primate research: But can a gorilla really grasp abstract concepts like climate change and biodiversity? \u201cOf course not,\u201d Herbert Terrace, director of Columbia University\u2019s Primate Cognition Lab, told The Huffington Post. Terrace criticized the video as \u201chighly misleading\u201d because \u201cwe don\u2019t know what Koko\u2019s trainer was signing to her before she uttered the various signs \u2026 attributed to her.\u201d Frans de Waal, director of Emory University\u2019s Living Links primate research center, suggested that the conservation video hurts the credibility of those who study animal intelligence. \u201cKoko\u2019s human-coached message goes well beyond anything that a gorilla understands or cares about, such as human global impact,\u201d de Waal told HuffPost. He added that \u201cstunts\u201d like this one \u201chave given the ape-language field a bad name, whereas there is so much more to discover if we just study what cognitively advanced animals can do of their own accord.\u201d \u201cThe problem comes in when we take an ape\u2019s accomplishments and then \u2026 insist \u2026 on putting her forward as a wise old woman, and she\u2019s not,\u201d [Barbara] King said. The Koko climate change PSA is a novel and compelling way of focusing viewer attention on a political message, but it\u2019s basically just a staged commercial, not an expression of sagacity about Nature issued by a non-human creature.

    "claim": "In July 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump said police officers should \"rough people up more\" and not to worry about injuring suspects during arrests, effectively endorsing use of excessive force by cops.",
    "content": " In May 2020, as many Americans protested the killing of George Floyd \u2014 a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck while Floyd pleaded to breathe \u2014 Twitter users claimed U.S. President Donald Trump helped motivate the officer\u2019s use of excessive force, simultaneously suggesting that the commander-in-chief supported the events that led to Floyd\u2019s death. Among those who claimed the connection between Floyd\u2019s death and Trump\u2019s rhetoric was Frank Figliuzzi, former assistant FBI director for counterintelligence and NBC News analyst, who tweeted on May 26, 2020: \u201cWhen assessing the Minneapolis police misconduct and current culture remember this from 2017: Trump tells cops they should rough people up more during arrests.\u201d His tweet included a link to a Vox story with a headline echoing his claim, a story that highlighted remarks by Trump on July 28, 2017, in front of a crowd of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, police officers, and sheriff\u2019s deputies at a Long Island community college in Suffolk County. Other tweets shared a Washington Post story about the same 2017 Trump event with the headline: \u201cTrump tells police not to worry about injuring suspects during arrests.\u201d   For the purpose of this examination, we\u2019ll focus on what appears to be the crux of the tweets\u2019 claims in May 2020: that Trump about three years earlier encouraged U.S. law enforcement officers to \u201crough people up more\u201d and not to worry about injuring suspects during arrests \u2014 essentially endorsing the use of excessive force by cops no matter the circumstances \u2014 despite local and federal policies that aim to protect civilians\u2019 legal rights and curb police misconduct.         First, we reviewed the source of the claim: Trump\u2019s remarks at the July 2017 event. At some point in the years between the 2017 speech and this report, the White House removed a copy of the speech transcript from the public archives where official addresses by the president are published. CSPAN footage of the July 2017 event, though, shows that the president spent most of his roughly 34-minute address emphasizing his administration\u2019s appreciation for law enforcement, calls to tighten the country\u2019s borders, and intolerance for U.S. gang violence, specifically among members of the Los Angeles-based Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, gang. Of ICE agents combating such crimes, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re rough. I don\u2019t want to be \u2014 say it because they\u2019ll say that\u2019s not politically correct. You\u2019re not allowed to have rough people doing this kind of work.\u201d The crowd responded to that comment and several others by the president with laughter and applause. Then, about 10 minutes later, Trump called on Congress to set aside more federal funding for ICE to dissolve the notorious gang and \u201croot out the criminal cartels from our country,\u201d adding: Now, we\u2019re getting them out anyway, but we\u2019d like to get them out a lot faster. And when you see these towns and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon \u2014 you just see them thrown in, rough \u2014 I said, please don\u2019t be too nice.  (Laughter.) Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you\u2019re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over? Like, don\u2019t hit their head and they\u2019ve just killed somebody \u2014 don\u2019t hit their head. I said, you can take the hand away, okay? In other words, the president did advise law enforcement officers not to be \u201ctoo nice\u201d with people in custody, without going into specifics on what that means or defining what level of \u201cnice\u201d cops should be while doing their jobs. He also encouraged officers to stop doing one procedure that aims to prevent injuries to civilians: the practice of protecting peoples\u2019 heads when they\u2019re handcuffed and ducking to get into squad cars. Yet it is important to point out a distinction between that comment and the claim: The president did not give officers the green light to injure people no matter the circumstances. Rather, he suggested that authorities should stop specific precautionary measures that could prevent civilians from suffering injuries. It\u2019s the difference between police intentionally shoving someone\u2019s head onto the roof of a squad car or instead guiding them into the vehicle in a way that could cause injury. Additionally, Trump did not explicitly say police should \u201crough people up more\u201d during arrests, even though he did use the word \u201crough\u201d several times in the speech to suggest what he envisions as an ideal law enforcement officer or detainment. After the remark, amid applause and cheers from the crowd, Trump turned around to address the first row of law enforcement officers behind him at the podium \u2014 some of whom were smiling.        The comments were controversial at the time, not just after Floyd\u2019s death in 2020. Civil and human rights activists immediately condemned their interpretation of the president\u2019s remarks and the nonchalant way in which he described a scenario that could result in suspect injuries in police custody. Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement: The President of the United States, standing before an audience of law enforcement officials, actively encouraged police violence. His remarks undermine the positive efforts of local law enforcement agencies and communities around the country working to address police misconduct and build community-police trust.  That backlash in 2017 also included criticism from U.S. police leaders and organizations that represent them. The chief of the Houston Police Department, for example, tweeted: \u201cTo be clear, inappropriate attempt at gallows humor does not reflect values of respect &amp; commitment to constitutional policing of the profession.\u201d  To conclude our examination, we looked at existing federal statutes and case law that aim to protect the civil rights of all Americans in police custody, no matter what crime police think they committed, and that aim to prevent cops from using \u201cmore force than is reasonably necessary to arrest or gain control of the victim,\u201d as the U.S. Department of Justice says on its website. If Trump had told police to \u201crough people up more\u201d during arrests, like the claim asserts, without explaining under what circumstances he would like that type of excessive force used, he would have essentially been encouraging law-enforcement to break the federal law in cases where force wasn\u2019t \u201creasonably necessary.\u201d In sum, while Trump did say in July 2017 that he would like to see \u201cthugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon\u201d and for officers not to \u201cbe too nice\u201d with people in custody, and while he encouraged police to stop one procedure that aims to prevent injuries to civilians, we rate this claim as \u201cMixture.\u201d He did not explicitly tell police to \u201crough people up more\u201d or to not worry about injuring suspects during arrests, though his comments could be interpreted as support for measures that could result in civilian injuries in police custody.

    "content": " On 4 June 2019, a video supposedly showing a man leaving his family behind as an avalanche crashed down a mountain toward a ski resort went viral on social media:  Me watching a bad situation and doing nothing till the final hour: pic.twitter.com/C4HC58sD7y \u2014 Sgogwana (@zama_mdluli) June 4, 2019  This video quickly racked up millions of views, and many social media users appeared to believe that they had just witnessed a real near-death moment. A number of people also chimed in to chastise the father for leaving his wife and children behind as the avalanche crashed down. Here\u2019s an excerpt from an article published by Barstool Sports: \u201cThis father should absolutely be beaten to within an inch of his life. After that, he should be nursed back to health and beaten again. It\u2019s one thing to make a mistake and think that a f*cking avalanche will just be goofin down the mountain and that there\u2019s nothing to worry about. It\u2019s an entirely different thing to see said avalanche barreling toward your family full of small children and to run out of the way without grabbing your kids because you\u2019re the biggest baby-backed bitch the world has ever known.\u201d         This video does not show a real-world incident. It is a scene from the 2014 Swedish film Force Majeure, which deals with the aftermath of this man\u2019s decision to abandon his family during a moment of danger. A synopsis of Force Majeure describes \u201cA man\u2019s selfish reaction to the danger posed by an avalanche causes cracks in his marriage and relationships with his children.\u201d Here\u2019s a higher-quality version of the scene:  The avalanche scene can also be glimpsed in the official trailer for Force Majeure:  "

    "claim": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump kicked a crying baby out of a political rally.",
    "content": " Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump took to Twitter (again) on 8 August 2016 to criticize the news media for lying about him, and one instance he highlighted was a story about his allegedly having kicked a crying baby out of a campaign rally in Ashburn, Virginia:  The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, \u201cthe baby\u201d and so much more. Very dishonest! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2016  Trump was referring to several misleading headlines published on 2 August 2016 that accused him of demanding that a crying infant be removed from the premises where his campaign was holding a political rally.  For instance, the New York Post ran a story under the headline \u201cTrump Loves Crying Baby, Then Kicks the Tot Out of His Rally,\u201d and the New York Daily News published a news video under the title \u201cTrump Kicks Crying Baby Out of Rally\u201d and stated Trump had \u201cbooted a fussy baby from a rally\u201d:  Donald Trump booted a fussy baby from a rally because the tot was wailing over the businessman\u2019s speech. \u201cYou can get the baby out of here,\u201d the GOP presidential nominee barked from the stage in Ashburn, Va. The baby banishment came just seconds after Trump bragged about his love of children and promised that the crying kid could stay.         Trump, however, didn\u2019t actually kick the squalling child out of his rally. Daniel Dale of the Toronto Star  wrote that he was sitting near the baby during the rally, and that while Trump really did make the comments captured in the above-displayed video, the incident was mischaracterized and Trump never actually ordered the tot be removed from the room. According to Dale, Trump said \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that baby\u201d when the infant first started crying, and when the child cried again, the mother quickly left the room to avoid interrupting the candidate. Trump noticed the woman leaving and called after her, \u201cYou can get the baby out of here.\u201d But the woman and the child both returned to their seats later in the rally:  The baby was one row in front of me, three or four rows from the stage, at Trump\u2019s event at a high school in Ashburn, Va. When it began to cry, Trump said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that baby, I love babies. I love babies. I hear that baby crying, I like it. I like it. What a baby, what a beautiful baby. Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. The mom\u2019s running around \u2014 don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d People applauded. One minute later, though, the baby began to cry again. This time, the mother quickly decided to take the baby out of the room. Trump, looking in our direction, appeared to notice that she was on her way to the exit. And then he said, \u201cActually, I was only kidding. You can get the baby out of here. That\u2019s all right. Don\u2019t worry. I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I\u2019m speaking?\u201d He cupped his hand over his eyes to watch her leave. \u201cThat\u2019s OK, people don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s OK.\u201d A joke? Possibly. An insensitive, heartless, ordinary-person-embarrassing remark? Possibly. Trump\u2019s tone is eternally hard to read. But, to my eyes, it certainly was not an ejection \u2014 it was an unusually barbed endorsement of the mother\u2019s own decision to depart. One other salient fact is missing from all the pieces on babygate. Mom and baby, very much not kicked out, came back to their seat a bit later.  Whatever Donald Trump may have said or meant,  he did not order that a crying child be removed from his rally, nor was the child or its mother required to leave. "

    "claim": "Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said in December 2019 that U.S. President Donald Trump had \"done nothing wrong\" with regard to Ukraine.",
    "content": " In December 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump, beset by a mounting, Democrat-led impeachment process, tried to dismiss allegations of wrongdoing in relation to his July 2019 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Trump\u2019s broader actions and policies toward Ukraine. That phone call has been the focus of intense scrutiny, amid allegations that Trump used U.S. aid to Ukraine (a U.S. ally) as leverage in attempting to force Zelensky to launch an investigation into former U.S. Vice President and leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. On Dec. 2, Trump tweeted: \u201cBreaking News: The President of Ukraine has just again announced that President Trump has done nothing wrong with respect to Ukraine and our interactions or calls. If the Radical Left Democrats were sane, which they are not, it would be case over!\u201d          We asked the White House to explain what the president was referring to and how those purported remarks amounted to an announcement by Zelensky that Trump had \u201cdone nothing wrong.\u201d We did not receive a response of any kind. However, Trump appeared to be alluding to a major interview Zelensky gave to four international news outlets: TIME in the U.S., Le Monde in France, Der Spiegel in Germany and Gazeta Wyborcza in Poland. Those news organizations published their respective transcripts of the interview on or around Dec. 2, with the exception of Der Spiegel, which had not yet released its own transcript at the time this fact check was published.  Zelensky answered one question that was directly and specifically relevant to his July 2019 phone call with Trump. The following is a breakdown of how three of the four outlets reported that section of the interview. TIME Q: When did you first sense that there was a connection between Trump\u2019s decision to block military aid to Ukraine this summer and the two investigations that Trump and his allies were asking for? Can you clarify this issue of the quid pro quo? Zelensky: Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That\u2019s not my thing\u2026I don\u2019t want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We\u2019re at war. If you\u2019re our strategic partner, then you can\u2019t go blocking anything for us. I think that\u2019s just about fairness. It\u2019s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying. Le Monde Q: Lors de cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, quand avez-vous senti le lien entre l\u2019aide militaire am\u00e9ricaine et la demande d\u2019enqu\u00eate formul\u00e9e par M. Trump sur Hunter Biden, le fils de son rival d\u00e9mocrate Joe Biden pour l\u2019\u00e9lection de 2020 ?        Zelensky: Nous n\u2019avons pas parl\u00e9 d\u2019un \u00e9change du genre \u00ab Je te donne ci et tu me donnes \u00e7a \u00bb. Ce type de conversation, je l\u2019ai eu avec le pr\u00e9sident russe lorsque nous avons \u00e9chang\u00e9 les prisonniers. Et je peux l\u2019avoir avec l\u2019Europe pour qu\u2019ils nous disent : \u00ab Remplissez telle ou telle condition pour rejoindre l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne [UE]. \u00bb L\u2019Ukraine se trouve en Europe et peut faire partie de l\u2019UE. Et nous le voulons. L\u00e0 je comprendrais qu\u2019il puisse y avoir un donnant-donnant\u2026 (Translated) Q: During that phone conversation, at what point did you sense the connection between American military aid and Mr. Trump\u2019s request for an inquiry into Hunter Biden, the son of his Democrat rival in the 2020 election, Joe Biden? Zelensky: We didn\u2019t talk about an exchange in terms of \u201cYou give my this and I give you that.\u201d I did have that type of conversation with the Russian president, when we conducted a prisoner exchange. And I could have [that type of conversation] with Europe if they say to us \u201cSatisfy this or that condition in order to join the European Union.\u201d Ukraine is in Europe and could become part of the EU. And we want that. In that case I could understand having a give-and-take\u2026 Gazeta Wyborcza Q: Jest wiele spekulacji na temat tego, kiedy pan zrozumia\u0142, \u017ce jest zwi\u0105zek mi\u0119dzy ameryka\u0144sk\u0105 wojenn\u0105 pomoc\u0105 i \u015bledztwami, o kt\u00f3re prosi\u0142 Trump [w sprawie Huntera Bidena i firmy Burisma]? Zelensky: Ja nie rozmawia\u0142em z Trumpem z pozycji \u201cco\u015b za co\u015b\u201d. W taki spos\u00f3b rozmawia\u0142em z prezydentem Rosji \u2013 oddaj mi tych, a my oddamy tych [wi\u0119\u017ani\u00f3w]. Czego potrzebujemy od USA? Nie chcemy wygl\u0105da\u0107 dzisiaj jak klient. Ale trzeba rozumie\u0107, \u017ce u nas toczy si\u0119 wojna. Je\u015bli jeste\u015bmy strategicznymi partnerami, to nie mo\u017cna nam czego\u015b blokowa\u0107. U nas by\u0142y posiedzenia z UE. Powiedzia\u0142em im otwarcie: zobaczcie, tak by\u0107 nie mo\u017ce, albo nas widzicie w UE, albo nie. My podkre\u015blamy: Ukraina znajduje si\u0119 w Europie i zak\u0142adamy, \u017ce mo\u017cemy by\u0107 cz\u0119\u015bci\u0105 UE, podzielamy te same warto\u015bci. Tutaj wymiana co\u015b za co\u015b jest dla mnie zrozumia\u0142\u0105\u2026        (Translated) Q: There has been a lot of speculation about when you understood that there was a link between American aid and the investigations Trump was asking for [regarding Hunter Biden and Burisma]. Zelensky: I didn\u2019t talk to Trump in terms of \u201cthis for that.\u201d I did talk like that with Putin \u2014 give them [prisoners] to me and I\u2019ll give them to you. What do we want from the U.S.? We don\u2019t want to look like a client. But you have to understand that we have a war zone going on here. If we\u2019re strategic partners, we can\u2019t block each other\u2019s business.  We had meetings with the EU. I told them explicitly: this is unacceptable. Either you see Ukraine as part of the EU or you don\u2019t. We emphasize: Ukraine is in Europe and we believe we can become part of the EU, we have the same core values. In that situation, a quid pro quo makes sense. Analysis Clearly, Zelensky did not say, word-for-word, that Trump had \u201cdone nothing wrong with respect to Ukraine and [the two men\u2019s] interactions or calls.\u201d However, Trump\u2019s tweet did not attribute that to Zelensky as a direct quotation, so it should not be evaluated as such. Rather, Trump was giving his own description or summary of what Zelensky had said. As we\u2019ve seen, Zelensky did say that, in their July phone conversation, he and Trump did not discuss a quid pro quo agreement or arrangement in which Trump would release military aid to Ukraine in exchange for Ukrainian authorities opening an investigation into the alleged (and unproven) activities of the Bidens in and with regard to Ukraine.  Without presenting supportive evidence, Trump and others have claimed that Joe Biden acted corruptly while he was vice president, because he pressured Ukrainian authorities to fire the country\u2019s top prosecutor in order to end an investigation into the owner of Burisma, a natural gas company whose board of directors included Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. However, former U.S. officials have rejected that theory, saying that Joe Biden pushed Ukraine to remove the prosecutor as part of a broader Obama administration drive against corruption in Ukraine.        The allegation that Trump used military aid to Ukraine as a bargaining chip, in exchange for an investigation that would prove damaging to one of his likely main rivals in the 2020 election, has so far undeniably been one of the principle allegations against the president. Therefore, when Zelensky said he and Trump did not discuss matters in terms of a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d he was undeniably exculpating Trump to a certain extent (whether or not Zelensky\u2019s description of the conversation actually measures up to what the White House call summary shows). As such, there is a measure of truth in Trump\u2019s claim that Zelensky said his American counterpart had done nothing wrong, but only as it relates specifically to that phone call.  The allegations of wrongdoing against Trump extend beyond the contents of one particular phone call in July. For example, Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the EU, has testified before Congress that Trump directed a months-long campaign of lobbying and persuading Ukrainian authorities to investigate the Bidens, as well as discredited claims that Ukraine (rather than Russia) was responsible for online efforts to intervene in the 2016 presidential election.  According to Sondland, that broader policy involved Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, acting at the president\u2019s direction, as well as other administration officials, and involved Trump directing his officials to freeze U.S. military aid to Ukraine. In his December 2019 interview, Zelensky did not address those wider allegations about Trump\u2019s Ukraine policy \u2014 he spoke only about one particular phone call. Therefore, Trump was only partly accurate in summarizing and describing what Zelensky said as \u201cPresident Trump has done nothing wrong with respect to Ukraine and our interactions or calls.\u201d "
