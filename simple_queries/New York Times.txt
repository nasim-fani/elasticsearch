    "title": "Did a 1922 Article Advise Not to Worry About Hitler\u2019s Anti-Semitism?",

    "claim": "A 1922 New York Times article reported that Adolf Hitler \u201cwas merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers\u201d.",
    "content": " On 10 February 2015, the New York Times re-released the first article they ever published about Adolf Hitler, who was then the chairman of the Nazi party. The story, dated 21 November 1922 and republished in the Times\u2018 \u201cFirst Glimpses\u201d section, opened with this introduction: On Nov. 21, 1922, The New York Times gave its readers their first glimpse of Hitler, in a profile that got a lot of things right \u2014 its description of his ability to work a crowd into a fever pitch, ready then and there to stage a coup, presaged his unsuccessful beer hall putsch less than a year later. But the article also got one crucial point very wrong \u2014 despite what \u201cseveral reliable, well-informed sources\u201d told The Times in the third paragraph from the bottom, his anti-Semitism was every bit as genuine and violent as it sounded. This re-release was widely covered by other news outlets immediately after it was posted in 2015, with many of them suggesting or implying its description bore similarities to the political movement of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. An excerpt from that 1922 article reads as follows: But several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitler\u2019s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers and keep them aroused, enthusiastic, and in line for the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to be employed effectively for political purposes. A sophisticated politician credited Hitler with peculiar political cleverness for laying emphasis and over-emphasis on anti-Semitism, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t expect the masses to understand or appreciate your finer real aims. You must feed the masses with cruder morsels and ideas like anti-Semitism. It would be politically all wrong to tell them the truth about where you really are leading them.\u201d This story was published early in both Hitler\u2019s career and in the existence of the Nazi party itself, whose followers were then called \u2018Hakenkreuzler,\u2019 or \u2018swastika wavers.\u2019 In November 1922, when this article was first published, Hitler had been Nazi party chairman for just over a year, and it had been only three years since he had delivered his first public political speech. Hitler\u2019s failed attempt to overthrow the local government in Bavaria, known as the \u201cBeer Hall Putsch,\u201d was one year away. The Times reached out to Hitler for comment in 1922, which he declined, as described in the story: \u201cHerr Hitler regrets he is unable to meet you as he is leaving town on important business for several days,\u201d was the answer received by The New York Times correspondent. His important business was going to Regensburg with three special trainloads of Munich admirers for the purpose of holding a series of reactionary inflammatory meetings and incidentally to beat up protesting Socialists and Communists with blackjacks if any dare protest, which is becoming increasingly rarer.

    "claim": "The New York Times published Darren Wilson's current residence address, then redacted it.",
    "content": " On 24 November 2014, the day St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced that a grand jury declined to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in connection with the death of Michael Brown, the New York Times published an article titled \u201cA Quiet Wedding for Darren Wilson.\u201d The article reported upon Wilson\u2019s recent wedding to fellow officer Barbara Spradling as well as the then-imminent indictment decision. Wilson, 28, and Spradling, 37, married on 24 October 2014 in St. Louis County. The Times coverage included the following text:  Both Officer Wilson and Officer Spradling were previously married, public records indicate. His divorce was finalized on Nov. 10, 2013. Officer Wilson and Officer Spradling own a home together on Manda Lane in Crestwood, Mo., a St. Louis suburb about a half-hour drive from Ferguson.  Although Wilson and Spradling owned a home in Crestwood, it was not their current residence at the time the article was published, as the paper noted that they had vacated the premises shortly after the 9 August 2014 shooting:  They have scarcely been seen there since Mr. Brown was killed on Aug. 9. Neighbors said that within a few days of the shooting, Officer Wilson and Officer Spradling abruptly left their home.  Along with the content of the article, the paper included a picture of Wilson and Spradling\u2019s marriage license. While the image included an address, that address was not the Crestwood house formerly occupied by the couple; it was the address of a law firm in nearby Clayton, Missouri. When the article drew scrutiny, the Times removed the image of Wilson and Spradling\u2019s marriage license and appended the following editor\u2019s note: \u201cAn earlier version of this post included a photograph that contained information that should not have been made public. The image has been removed.\u201d That redaction led many readers to mistakenly believe that the Times had published Wilson\u2019s current residence address and then withdrawn that information due to public protest, but the address published by the paper in the since-edited article was for a law firm and not for the domicile in which Wilson was currently living. The Times did mention that Wilson and his wife own a house in Crestwood and referenced the street name, but they did not publish the full address. Moreover, that information was neither current nor revelatory in nature since (as noted in the same article) the Wilsons had vacated the house months earlier, and that same information had already been widely disseminated back in August 2014 in coverage of the Mike Brown case published in major newspapers such as the  Washington Post and the Boston Globe.

    "claim": "The New York Times published an op-ed by Adolf Hitler in 1941. ",
    "content": " On June 3, 2020, The New York Times published an op-ed by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton entitled \u201cSend in the Troops,\u201d which argued that President Donald Trump should use military force to put an end to the nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice that followed the killing of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody. The op-ed sparked backlash, with many arguing that giving publicity to such an opinion put the lives of protesters, as well as black staffers at The New York Times, in danger. The New York News Guild also released a statement that they were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the publishing of this column.  As the backlash grew online, some argued that The New York Times\u2019 publishing of Cotton\u2019s opinion piece shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise since \u201cThe Gray Lady\u201d had also published an op-ed by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler back in 1941.           This is a genuine image of an article that was published in New York Times Magazine in 1941. However, \u201cop-ed\u201d may not be the best descriptor for this content, as it is actually an excerpt from Hitler\u2019s manifesto \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d  It was preceded by an introductory paragraph explaining that Germany was at that time waging a war of propaganda against the United States based on principles Hitler himself outlined in the excerpt:  Germany is now waging a psychological war against this country as well as a military war in other parts of the world. That psychological war is based on the principles of propaganda laid down by Adolf Hitler in his autobiography \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d Below the book\u2019s most important passages on propaganda are published. This was therefore not a case of the Times providing op-ed space for a particular political view, but rather to educate its readers about the propaganda methods being used against Americans by the Nazis. This article from New York Times Magazine can be found in the newspaper\u2019s \u201ctime machine.\u201d "

    "claim": "Donald Trump gave an unprecedented order for all politically appointed ambassadors to resign immediately.",
    "content": " On 5 January 2016, the New York Times published an article concerning a State Department cable sent to diplomats on 23 December 2016 by President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team, informing them that they were to leave their posts prior to Inauguration Day \u201cwithout exception\u201d: President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s transition staff has issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day, according to several American diplomats familiar with the plan, breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods. The mandate \u2014 issued \u201cwithout exceptions,\u201d according to a terse State Department cable sent on Dec. 23, diplomats who saw it said \u2014 threatens to leave the United States without Senate-confirmed envoys for months in critical nations like Germany, Canada and Britain. In the past, administrations of both parties have often granted extensions on a case-by-case basis to allow a handful of ambassadors, particularly those with school-age children, to remain in place for weeks or months. Mr. Trump, by contrast, has taken a hard line against leaving any of President Obama\u2019s political appointees in place as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20 with a mission of dismantling many of his predecessor\u2019s signature foreign and domestic policy achievements. \u201cPolitical\u201d ambassadors, many of them major donors who are nominated by virtue of close ties with the president, almost always leave at the end of his term; ambassadors who are career diplomats often remain in their posts. A State Department official confirmed to Politico  that the Trump transition team would not be making any exceptions for ambassadors requesting extensions to remain at their posts. Aggregated versions of the New York Timess report, social media summaries, and a general misunderstanding of what the New York Times  had&amp; actually reported led many readers to believe that President-elect Trump had broken precedent when he ordered political ambassadors appointed by President Obama to leave their posts by his inauguration date. However, the \u201cprecedent\u201d at the center of the Times article had to do with whether the incoming president would allow exceptions for outgoing ambassadors who wished to remain in their positions for a period of time past Inauguration Day. While previous administrations have allowed exceptions on a case-by-case basis, the incoming Trump administration broke with that tradition by saying that ambassadors had to leave their posts \u201cwithout exception.\u201d         Asgeir Sigfusson, a spokesperson for the American Foreign Service Association, was even hesitant to say that Trump\u2019s no-extensions policy was unprecedented. Instead, Sigfusson noted that AFSA members had called it \u201cunusual,\u201d while Ambassador Barbara Stephenson, president of the American Foreign Service Association noted that Trump\u2019s policy was atypical: \u201cWe go through this process every time there is a change of administration. Political appointees are generally expected to prepare for departure around the time a new President is inaugurated, particularly if there is a change of party. We understand the new administration is adhering strictly to a no-extensions policy, which is not always the case. It\u2019s important to point out that embassies have a Deputy Chief of Mission, a career diplomat who serves as charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires until a new Ambassador is confirmed. That person is always a career Foreign Service officer, typically with decades of experience, and is selected with the expectation that he or she is fully up to the task of running an Embassy.\u201d John Kirby, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, also said that the policy was unusual and that previous administrations had granted a \u201chandful\u201d of exceptions, but he confirmed that political appointees should have no expectation of staying at their posts beyond the term of the president who appointed them: So look, I think I can break this down pretty easily, as I\u2019ve seen the press coverage on this as well. All political appointees for the Obama Administration were directed to submit their letters of resignation, and the due date was December 7th, and the resignations are to take effect at noon on January 20th. All political appointees were directed to do that. That is common, typical practice. And when you\u2019re a political appointee for this or any other administration, you have no expectation of staying beyond the inauguration of a new administration. That\u2019s the way it works. For career Foreign Service officers, there this year has been no such directive, no such expectation for them to have to submit resignations at the end of the term. Now, I can\u2019t speak for the incoming team, but all political appointees \u2014 and frankly, even careers as ambassadors or military admirals and generals \u2014 you serve at the pleasure of the president. So the incoming team can make decisions on their own about who they want in what chair and for how long. But all political appointees under this Administration, including a knucklehead like me, you have to submit your resignation and be prepared to have January 20th be your last day in office. You serve at the pleasure of the president, and when your president \u2014 his terms runs out, you have every expectation that your term will run out. That\u2019s the way it works. [\u2026] You\u2019d have to talk to the Trump transition team about why they decided to not be willing to broker exceptions or waivers, requests to extend. I can\u2019t speak to that. That\u2019s really for them. But \u2014 hang on. But you\u2019re right that in the past there have been a handful, a small number, of extension requests granted, but that is totally in the prerogative of the incoming team. And for \u2014 it\u2019s for them to determine whether they\u2019d be willing to accept or deny individual requests to extend. It\u2019s really for them to speak to. Peter Cianchette, for instance, was made an ambassador to Costa Rica by President George W. Bush in June 2008, and President Obama allowed Cianchette to remain in his position until July 2009. Similarly, Diane E. Watson, who was appointed an ambassador of Micronesia by former President Bill Clinton, remained at her post long after George W. Bush assumed office. We found similar examples of presidents allowing ambassadors appointed by their predecessors to remain at their posts past Inauguration Day for every presidential transition dating back to 1977, when Jimmy Carter succeeded Gerald Ford. When President Obama requested ambassador resignations before the start of his administration in 2009, a State Department official told Agence France-Presse that requests for extensions by political ambassadors would be looked at on a case-by-case basis: \u201cThe message was something that is normally sent out (after every election every four years) by the State Department at the request of the White House,\u201d the State Department official said. \u201cIt\u2019s a normal procedure for ambassadors, career and non-career, to submit their resignations. And what happens is that all of them do,\u201d according to the official who added the message was sent out Tuesday. \u201cAnd in many cases, career ambassadors will be notified that they can stay in place,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also have from time to time political (appointee) ambassadors who come in with requests to maybe extend for a couple of months for family reasons or whatever, and those are looked at on a case-by-case basis,\u201d he said.

    "claim": "New York Times columnist hailed the election of Donald Trump as a \"complete repudiation of Barack Obama.\"",
    "content": " It is well known that New York Times political columnist Maureen Dowd is not a fan of President-elect Donald Trump (nor he of her, for that matter, having called Dowd \u201cwacky\u201d and a \u201cneurotic dope\u201d in angry tweets), so Facebook users were quite surprised to see blurbs in their news feeds a month or so after the election for an column in which she seemingly hailed Trump\u2019s election as a welcome corrective to eight years of rule by liberal Democrats: The most amazing part of this well written piece is the fact Maureen Dowd, a liberal columnist from the New York Times wrote it! Maureen Dowd Election Therapy From My Basket of Deplorables The election was a complete repudiation of Barack Obama: his fantasy world of political correctness, the politicization of the Justice Department and the I.R.S., an out-of-control E.P.A., his neutering of the military, his nonsupport of the police and his fixation on things like transgender bathrooms. Since he became president, his party has lost 63 House seats, 10 Senate seats and 14 governorships. The country had signaled strongly in the last two midterms that they were not happy. The Dems\u2019 answer was to give them more of the same from a person they did not like or trust. Preaching \u2014 and pandering \u2014 with a message of inclusion, the Democrats have instead become a party where incivility and bad manners are taken for granted, rudeness is routine, religion is mocked and there is absolutely no respect for a differing opinion. This did not go down well in the Midwest, where Trump flipped three blue states and 44 electoral votes\u2026. It continues in that vein. Not to minimize the pleasure Trump voters must have felt reading such an articulate defense of their choice of candidates, but Maureen Dowd did not, in fact, write the bulk of that column, even though it carried her byline. Some of the folks who copied and pasted it onto their Facebook pages omitted critical paragraphs at the beginning of the article announcing that what was to follow was written by a member of Dowd\u2019s own \u201clittle basket of deplorables, as I call my conservative family\u201d \u2014 her Republican brother, Kevin. Here\u2019s an excerpt from that introduction: My colleague Paul Krugman tweeted Friday that \u201caffluent, educated suburbanites\u201d who voted for Trump are \u201cfools.\u201d What else is there to say, he asked. Well, here is what Kevin, an affluent, educated suburbanite has to say in his column, titled an \u201cElection Therapy Guide for Liberals.\u201d The column can be read in its entirety here. "

    "claim": "The New York Times contradicted their 20 January 2017 report about wire tapping in an article entitled \"Trump, Offering No Evidence, Says Obama Tapped His Phones.\"",
    "content": " In March 2017, several web outlets circulated an image purportedly showing the front page of the 20 January 2017 print edition of the New York Times along with accusations that the newspaper\u2019s reporting on President Trump\u2019s claims that former President Obama had ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower phones had been contradictory:  The front page of The New York Times way back on January 20, 2017\u2026 \u201cWiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides\u201d But Two months later they are trashing their own reports! Now the NY Times is reporting there is no evidence of a wiretap. No wonder nobody trusts them! The image is of the Times\u2018 front page and its \u201cWiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides\u201d is real. It\u2019s also true that the New York Times reported about two months later that President Trump had offered no evidence to back up his claim that the Obama administration had tapped his phones. However, these two articles are not contradictory In order for the New York Times 4 March 2017 report (\u201cTrump, Offering No Evidence, Says Obama Tapped His Phones\u201d) to contradict the newspaper\u2019s 20 January 2017 report (\u201cWiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides\u201d), the paper would have had to have provided evidence (or at least asserted) that the earlier article was based on an Obama administration wiretap of Trump\u2019s phones. This, of course, was not the case.  Although the Janaury article did use the words \u201cwiretapped\u201d and \u201cTrump\u201d in its title, it did not state that Trump Tower telephones were specifically targeted by a wiretap initiated by the Obama administration. Rather, the article stated that intelligence agencies were monitoring Russian officials, and that some of the conversations they intercepted in the course of their investigations may have also involved Trump aides: Counterintelligence investigations examine the connections between American citizens and foreign governments. Those connections can involve efforts to steal state or corporate secrets, curry favor with American government leaders or influence policy. It is unclear which Russian officials are under investigation, or what particular conversations caught the attention of American eavesdroppers. The legal standard for opening these investigations is low, and prosecutions are rare.         Furthermore, the article stated that it was still unclear if the intercepted communications were linked to the Trump campaign, or Trump himself, at all:  --> It is not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, or Mr. Trump himself. It is also unclear whether the inquiry has anything to do with an investigation into the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computers and other attempts to disrupt the elections in November. The American government has concluded that the Russian government was responsible for a broad computer hacking campaign, including the operation against the D.N.C. This article, which was also published online under the title \u201cIntercepted Russian Communications Part of Inquiry Into Trump Associates,\u201d was cited in a 3 March 2017 Breitbart report which many pundits believe was the basis for President Trump\u2019s wiretap claim again his predecessor. Although radio host Mark Levin collected several reports related to wiretapping and Trump\u2019s alleged connections with Russia, no evidence has yet surfaced showing that the Obama administration had initiated a wiretap of Trump Tower phones: The problem here, of course, is that what Levin \u2014 and Breitbart \u2014 use as evidence for these claims are a series of seemingly unconnected events \u2014 from FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) court requests to Trump joking about the Russia email hack, to the release of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails in the fall. The proof that all \u2014 or any \u2014 of these events are tied together by actual facts as opposed to supposition is not offered. The White House has offered no further evidence of Trump\u2019s claims \u2014 as of this publishing. Matt Rosenberg, one of the authors of the above-quoted Times article, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that nowhere in his reporting did it state that Trump himself was under surveillance:   \u201cIf we knew now, that they were monitoring Donald Trump\u2019s communications\u2026we would be saying that\u201d @AllMattNYT https://t.co/PRenVfFvtt \u2014 Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 (@AC360) March 8, 2017  Cooper: Does your reporting in any way suggest the claim the president is making that President Obama tapped then-candidate trump\u2019s phone? Rosenberg: Nowhere in this story does it say that. It says that there is a broad investigation based on wiretapped and intercepted communications. It does not say whose communications were intercepted. I\u2019d also point readers, and something that people conveniently leave out, to another story we published last week on March 1 that explicitly says that much of the communications were Russians talking to Russians. They were hearing about things through those conversations. Is there a FISA warrant were there wiretaps on Donald Trump or any of his campaign people\u2019s phones? I don\u2019t know that. We don\u2019t know that. If we knew that it would absolutely be in the newspaper. Cooper: So the communications you were discussing in the article were Russians talking to Russians? Rosenberg: They are Russians talking to Russians. The communication in the 19th article, I can\u2019t get into the sourcing very deeply, But I can tell you absolutely that if we knew at that time or if we knew now that they were monitoring Donald trump\u2019s communications, or any of his advisers regularly, and we could say that explicitly, we would be saying that in the newspaper. That is a news story. And the same thing goes with Michael Flynn. They bring up Michael Flynn\u2019s communications with the Russian ambassador. He was picked up talking because he was talking to the Russian ambassador whose phone was absolutely monitored. And have been probably monitoring Russian ambassadors for what, 70 years now. That\u2019s why [Flynn] was picked up. They weren\u2019t tracking Michael Flynn or wiretapping his calls. They were listening to the Russian ambassador and [Flynn] got on the phone with him and started talking and that\u2019s why he was heard. Cooper: I want to read the line from your article that mentions the word \u2018wiretapping.\u2019 It says: \u2018One official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House.\u2019 Do you have any sense of who was being wiretapped? Was that the Russian-to-Russian communications? Rosenberg: I want to get careful on that. I don\u2019t want to get into who was being wiretapped. But saying that it was \u2018provided to the White House\u2019 is not the same as saying that it was Trump. And one thing that I want to get clear and something I don\u2019t think most people understand is that in most cases when people are on the phone \u2014 say two foreign officials are talking about an American \u2014 the name of that American is going to be masked. It\u2019s going to be blacked out. Only certain people can have it unmasked. Only under certain conditions can it be unmasked. If you need it for context in a security situation you could. People may be able to figure out from context who it is, but the name isn\u2019t ordinarily available in reports that are distributed in the intelligence community. When Rosenberg was pressed on the issue by CNN commentator Jeffrey Lord, he responded that \u201conly the most obtuse misreading\u201d of the article would lead one to conclude that Donald Trump was under surveillance.

    "claim": "Chelsea Clinton tweeted that \"genital mutilation\" is a culturally loaded, racist term, and that the practice of \"genital cutting\" has many health benefits.",
    "content": " The final week of April 2017 saw an outburst of vitriol on Facebook and Twitter in reaction to comments allegedly tweeted by Chelsea Clinton defending the practice of female genital mutilation. The World Health Organization defines female genital mutilation (FGM) as \u201call procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\u201d \u201cGenital mutilation is a culturally loaded, racist term,\u201d Clinton supposedly wrote. \u201cThe correct term is genital cutting, and has many health benefits.\u201d Here is a brief sampling of the kind of responses that appeared on Twitter:  @ChelseaClinton is an Advocate for Female Genital Mutilation. This is Extremely Disturbing, Sickening! #Women #FGM @WHO @womenshealth pic.twitter.com/0krdEW64JE \u2014 Green Diplomacy (@GreenDiplomacy) April 28, 2017           Liberals are mind numb. Chelsea Clinton on twitter writes genital mutilation is racist term should be genital cutting im with #muslims \u2014 Real News Wire (@realnewswire) April 28, 2017   @ChelseaClinton since you approve of genital cutting (genital mutilation) when will your daughter be getting her genitals cut? \u2014 J T loves COVFEFE (@JodiTarvin) April 27, 2017  Interestingly, the majority of these retorts were addressed to Clinton\u2019s verified Twitter account (@ChelseaClinton), even though no such tweet ever issued from it. Based on what we were able to find in the public record, Chelsea Clinton has never suggested that female genital mutilation (FGM) be called anything other than what it is, nor claimed that FGM has \u201chealth benefits,\u201d nor taken anything less than a strong stand against it. For example, she unambiguously tweeted, not two weeks before this controversy erupted, that female genital mutilation must be eradicated wherever it\u2019s found:  Tragic that #FGM occurs in the U.S. or anywhere. We must #endFGM. Learn more about what the world needs to do here: https://t.co/FKgDNw4fe6 https://t.co/6Y18kZYbOW \u2014 Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) April 13, 2017  The only \u201cevidence\u201d that Chelsea Clinton has ever said anything to the contrary is this purported screenshot of a 26 April 2017 tweet from the \u201c@ClintonChelsea\u201d account (note the reversal of first and last names), which is not verified and does not belong to Chelsea Clinton:         As one would expect, Clinton did not react favorably to scores of people tweeting that she or her daughter ought to be subjected to genital mutilation, especially given that the message in which she allegedly expressed support for it was a hoax:  Both this fake account &amp; replies to it are often vile. Repeatedly have asked @Twitter to suspend. Asking again here. pic.twitter.com/UNBQOYWJnB \u2014 Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) April 29, 2017  We don\u2019t know who created the hoax, but we can speculate with a fair degree of certainty what inspired it: a 21 April 2017 reply by a New York Times editor to readers questioning the use of the phrase \u201cgenital cutting\u201d instead of \u201cgenital mutilation\u201d in an article about a case reported in Michigan: We asked Celia Dugger, the editor of Health and Science, to explain he reasoning behind the decision. I began writing about this back in 1996 when I was an immigration reporter on the Metro desk covering the asylum case of Fauziya Kassindja. I decided in the course of reporting that case \u2014 especially after a reporting trip to Togo, her home country, and the Ivory Coast \u2014 to call it genital cutting rather than mutilation. I never minced words in describing exactly what form of cutting was involved, and there are many gradations of severity, and the terrible damage it did, and stayed away from the euphemistic circumcision, but chose to use the less culturally loaded term, genital cutting. There\u2019s a gulf between the Western (and some African) advocates who campaign against the practice and the people who follow the rite, and I felt the language use widened that chasm.  The editor, Celia Dugger, not only expressed a preference for the term \u201cgenital cutting\u201d (as Chelsea Clinton supposedly did in the tweet), but defended her choice by characterizing it as a \u201cless culturally loaded term.\u201d In terms of timing, the fake Clinton tweet appeared only a few days after the New York Times editorial comment, a fact some partisans attempted to use to their advantage:   Chelsea &amp; the NY Times decides to sugar coat Female Genital Mutilation, is there nothing sacred to the PC Nut Jobs?! https://t.co/BOnQ5McZps pic.twitter.com/zaibFD62Um \u2014 JC Shannon (@BillClintonTHOF) April 28, 2017  Despite such claims, all the outrage surrounding Clinton\u2019s alleged comments about FGM was (and remains) pointless, however. The tweet was a hoax. "

    "claim": "A photograph shows three buildings in New York decorated with window crosses for Easter in 1956.",
    "content": "   Example: [Collected via Facebook, November 2015]  The above-displayed image of buildings in the New York skyline illuminating their windows with crosses for Easter has gone through several cycles of viral popularity over the years and is usually posted along with a claim that such a display would never be allowed in modern times. The image is real and was taken shortly before Easter in 1956. One newspaper, the Oxnard Press-Courier, published the photo on 31 March 1956 with the following caption:  Huge crosses, formed by lighted windows, blaze above New York\u2019s skyline as part of an Easter display in Manhattan\u2019s financial district. This scene, photographed from the roof of the Municipal Building, features 150-foot-high crosses in the City Services Co., City Bank   Farmers Trust Co., and the Forty Wall Street Corp. buildings. (United Press Telephoto)             As for the claim that this form of light display would cause an uproar today, it should be noted that Oklahoma City used building windows to depict crosses during the holidays as recently as 2010:  The Empire State Building also displays festive lights during religious holidays (red, green and white for Christmas, pastal fades for Easter, blue and white for Chanukah) and Chicago\u2019s Daley Plaza has featured a Nativity Scene since 1984.

    "claim": "In the 17th century, New Amsterdam built a protective wall along its northern perimeter (analogous to Trump's border wall) to keep \"bad hombres\" out, but it failed to achieve its stated purpose in that the British successfully invaded the city by sea.",
    "content": " In early January 2019, as the battle between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over funding for Trump\u2019s promised border wall dragged on, social media users weighed in with arguments for and against erecting a physical barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border. One of the more interesting claims to emerge from these debates was that a protective wall built by Dutch settlers on the northern border of 17th-century New Amsterdam (now New York City) failed to accomplish its stated purpose \u2014 that is, stopping outsiders from invading the city. In 1664, New Amsterdam was overtaken by the British, who eventually demolished the wall and replaced it with a street (aptly named Wall Street). The specifics of the claims varied from post to post. A 29 December entry shared on the subreddit r/nyc said the wall was built \u201cTo keep the Indians out.\u201d Another version claimed the wall was built to keep the British out:  Do you know why they call it Wall Street in NYC? Because the Dutch literally built a wall to keep the British out of Dutch colonies. You want to know how well walls work? It isn\u2019t called New Amsterdam anymore.https://t.co/VnztJ2jxHU \u2014 Ocular Nervosa (@ocularnervosa) January 5, 2019          And yet another said the wall was built in the 1640s and was meant to keep the \u201cbad hombres\u201d out (an apparent reference to Trump\u2019s characterization of undocumented immigrants):  In the 1640\u2019s the Dutch inhabitants of New Amsterdam built a 12\u2032 wall to keep the bad hombres out. In 1664 the British ignored the wall and took New Amsterdam by sea. It\u2019s now called New York. They took down the wall and built a street. It\u2019s called Wall Street. pic.twitter.com/Cbhp9N8BDW \u2014 Joe Delmonaco (@JoeDelmonaco) January 7, 2019  Although the broad outlines of the story were accurate, the devil (as always) was in the details. The wall was built neither in 1625 nor in the 1640s, but in 1653, the year New Amsterdam, a Dutch settlement comprising the southern tip of Manhattan Island, was formally chartered as a city. The Dutch Republic was at war with England at the time. The stated purpose of the wall was to prevent the English (not Native Americans) from invading by land. According to city records, news reached New Amsterdam\u2019s leadership in March 1653 that British troops were amassing in New England (\u201cfor either defense or attack, which is unknown to us\u201d). They resolved to \u201csurround the greater part of the City with a high stockade and a small breastwork\u201d to defend against a possible land invasion. Thus began the planning and construction of the wall, which would consist of palisades of 9-foot-tall (not 12-foot-tall) wooden planks extending east to west across the breadth of the island. It was completed in four months. One of the best short histories of the New Amsterdam wall is a five-part essay by Michael Lorenzini of the New York City Municipal Archives, based on original records from the period. One thing he points out is that the wall was only one component of a system of defenses that included ditches in front of the wall, cannon emplacements on the river banks, and Fort Amsterdam at the southernmost end of the island, from which the Dutch could fire upon approaching ships.        Although the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652-1654) ended without the wall\u2019s being put to the test, it did play a part in the city\u2019s defense when Native American tribes attacked New Amsterdam in 1655, leaving a section of it damaged by fire. \u201cThe wall was rebuilt and enforced,\u201d Lorenzini told us via email, \u201cand practically every year there was a huge public works project to improve it, including in 1664 when they received word that English ships were on the way.\u201d Despite the end of official hostilities 10 years earlier, the English had never given up their designs on New Amsterdam. When in March 1664 King Charles II deeded all the land from Maine to Delaware to his brother, the Duke of York, the city scrambled to reinforce their defenses. A few months later, four British warships sailed into the harbor with the clear intention of taking the city. Not wanting bloodshed, New Amsterdam surrendered. Not a shot was fired. Is it reasonable to conclude from that outcome (as some critics of Trump\u2019s border wall have argued) that \u201cwalls don\u2019t work\u201d? Arguably, the wall did work, in that the British never attempted to invade New Amsterdam by land. We put the question to Lorenzini, asking him first if he found the comparison between New Amsterdam\u2019s wall and Trump\u2019s border wall apt. \u201cIn some ways, maybe,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut I would say it\u2019s more akin to the walled cities of Europe than a border wall such as the Great Wall of China or Hadrian\u2019s Wall.\u201d One example of a walled city was New Amsterdam\u2019s European namesake, Amsterdam, which was surrounded by defensive walls from the Middle Ages through the late 19th century. But the central purpose of all those walls was repelling invaders, not keeping out immigrants. In fact, the Dutch would have regarded stopping the comings and goings of peaceful foreigners as antithetical to their interests. Lorenzini continued: New Amsterdam was a port city; the lifeblood was the free flow of ships into and out of the docks along the waterfront. They traded with everyone, including the English, and especially the native Americans. What they were afraid of was English troops from the Connecticut and Massachusetts colonies coming into the city from the north, and, post-1655, raids from native tribes. At various times they were in conflict with the English and the tribes, but they always wanted to resolve differences and continue trading. The English were able to take the city peacefully because they promised the merchants to respect the traditions of the Dutch and keep what we would now call the multi-cultural flavor. Not to put too fine a point on it, but it might have been a Dutch city, but it was a city filled with various religions and ethnic groups and they liked it that way, unlike the Puritan cities to the north, which strived for homogeneous societies. So, it was a military border, not a border to provide immigration control. As a military border, it served its purpose \u2014 no one ever attacked the city from the north \u2014 but much like the Maginot Line in France, it provided a false sense of security and was easily bypassed. The Dutch colony of New Netherlands was not just the lower tip of Manhattan. It extended from Albany to Brooklyn and Queens and down to Delaware and a couple-hundred-meter wall was not going to protect the whole colony. Certainly the wall was thought valuable to the city\u2019s defenses by the English, who continued to expand and maintain it (as would the Dutch when they temporarily reclaimed the city in 1673-4) over the next three decades. It wasn\u2019t until 1699, when New York City had essentially outgrown the wall (and the wall had outlived its purpose), that city officials finally petitioned for its demolition, calling for the stones recovered from the battlements that then stood at intervals along the palisades to be repurposed to build a new City Hall. To clear up one last misconception, it is not the case that the street now known as Wall Street only came into existence after the wall was torn down. Known to the Dutch as the Cingel, the street was ready in use when the British assumed control of New Amsterdam in 1664. As they did with the city itself, they simply claimed it as their own and renamed it. "
