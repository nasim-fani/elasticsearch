    "claim": "Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly was found dead on Long Island.",
    "content": " On 21 May 2017, the Daily USA Update web site published an article purporting to reveal \u201cmore details about the sad death\u201d of former Fox News anchor Bill O\u2019Reilly: The Islip Coroner\u2019s Office stated that last night, Bill O\u2019Reilly was found dead at his home in Long Island. It seems that Bill decided to take his own life. This morning, LLOD reporter Skip Tetheluda was there when the family asked the media not to hold a press conference at this time, because they want to have privacy at this difficult and sad moment. Tetheluda told us: \u201cBill O\u2019Reilly did not want to spend the rest of his life, led by some false claims that he is some old douche who can\u2019t keep his hands to himself. So, it seems that he does not want a life full of embarrassment, so he decided to blew the back of his head off with a 45 caliber handgun that was in his possession. There was found a note at the crime scene. Even though the investigators did not want to reveal the message, we find out that O\u2019Reilly wrote an apology to his daughter and wife and that he was sorry that they will always look him as a monster.\u201d  The article contained numerous similarities to one published by the fake news site America\u2019s Last Line of Defense: Bill O\u2019Reilly, found dead at his home on Long Island last night, took his own life, according to the Islip Coroner\u2019s Office. LLOD reporter Skip Tetheluda was onsite this morning when the family asked the coroner not to hold a press conference so they could maintain some privacy during this difficult time. Tetheluda told us by phone: \u201cBill O\u2019Reilly was looking at spending the rest of his life surrounded by mounting allegations that he was a filthy old scumbag who couldn\u2019t keep his hands to himself. He decided not to try living with the embarrassment and instead blew the back of his head off with a .45 caliber handgun he kept in his desk \u2026 A note on scene wasn\u2019t read out loud but this reporter heard mention of an apology to his wife and daughter and concern that they would always see him as the monster that he was.\u201d There was no truth to the claim Bill O\u2019Reilly was found dead, as the former Fox News host is still hosting his newly launched podcast and commenting on current events. Such reports originated with America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a fake news site whose disclaimer identifies its content as \u201csatirical\u201d in nature: The Resistance may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don\u2019t necessarily exist.

    "claim": "Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly was fired from NBC before even starting on air there.",
    "content": " In early March 2017, a round of hoax stories had many readers wondering whether Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News host, had left the cable news channel for NBC News only to be quickly fired before even making it to the air. The fake news story about Megyn Kelly contains a made-up quote from a made-up NBC Universal executive claiming that she had been replaced by conservative commentator Elizabeth Hasselbeck:  They came up with the perfect replacement. Elizabeth Hasselbeck, who nobody would ever consider a journalist but is a well-known and very attractive conservative woman, will be taking over the slot left open by Kelly. According to NBC Universal CEO Maxwell Seawald: \u201cElizabeth was thrilled to take over the afternoon slot Kelly was fired from. She\u2019s perfectly happy to be our version of Kelly Ripa and shows no interest in being taken seriously. Since her time as the cute pigtailed girl on Survivor she\u2019s always loved being an entertainer. Her time on Fox sealed that. She was the eye candy on the couch at Fox and friends and she\u2019ll do very nicely in the same role on \u2018Elizabeth\u2019.\u201d The CEO of NBC Universal is actually Stephen Burke, not \u201cMaxwell Seawald,\u201d and the network does not have an executive by that name. Kelly is expected to start her new stint on NBC in the fall of 2017. She left Fox News when her contract expired. She had been one of the female employees at Fox to level sexual harassment allegations against former chairman Roger Ailes: In recent months, Kelly\u2019s future in broadcast journalism was up in the air as her contract came up for renegotiation. Her public clash with Donald Trump, the publication of her memoir and her popularity at Fox News elevated her profile and gave her additional bargaining leverage. Meanwhile, internal turmoil at Fox News swirled as longtime Chairman Roger Ailes departed the network amid accusations of sexual harassment. Kelly leveled accusations of sexual harassment against Ailes in her memoir, \u201cSettle for More,\u201d which described an episode in which Ailes made repeated and unwanted advances before asking her when her contract expired.         Kelly will anchor a daily program that will air Monday through Friday and will also host a Sunday evening news show, per NBC: As part of the multi-year agreement, Kelly will also anchor a new Sunday evening news magazine show and will become an important contributor to NBC\u2019s breaking news coverage as well as the network\u2019s political and special events coverage. The claim that Kelly was fired from NBC News originally came from TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a repeat offender that carries a buried disclaimer on its \u201cAbout\u201d page stating that it is a satirical web site, and that information it publishes is thus not reliable: DISCLAIMER: The Resistance may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don\u2019t necessarily exist. All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney. Pictures that represent actual people should be considered altered and not in any way real. The same site spread a very similar rumor at the same time about a colleague of Megyn Kelly\u2019s: longtime Fox News anchor Shep Smith. He, like Kelly, has not been fired. "

    "content": " On 4 May 2017, the America\u2019s Last Line of Defense web site (and numerous related shill sites) published an article positing that former Fox News Channel host Bill O\u2019Reilly, who had recently parted ways with Fox in the wake of accusations of sexual harassment, had been hospitalized in New York after being beaten by a group of cowardly \u201cliberals\u201d who accosted him at a bagel shop: Bill O\u2019Reilly was reportedly at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was approached by two women and three men who said they were \u201cdisgusted\u201d by his behavior towards women at Fox News. O\u2019Reilly, who has never been afraid of anyone, turned and told the group to grow up and leave him alone. That\u2019s when the \u201ctolerant\u201d liberals got violent. One of the men grabbed O\u2019Reilly and dragged him out into the street, according to witnesses, where the other two men proceeded to kick him until he was unconscious and bleeding. The 5 perpetrators, who are still at large, ran off like the cowards they are. The police arrived within minutes and called for medical help. O\u2019Reilly was taken to St. Vincent\u2019s where he is in critical condition with 4 broken ribs and a punctured lung. Doctors also fear that he had a cardiac event and have him on a monitor. The doctors are hopeful. None of this was true: No legitimate news outlet reported that Bill O\u2019Reilly was beaten or hospitalized, and he continues hosting his \u201cNo Spin\u201d material via his new podcasting venture. This report originated with America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a clickbait fake news site whose disclaimer notes that \u201call articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\u201d "

Hannity\u2019s bump and bruise fender bender with a Ford Pickup truck did far more damage than originally thought. The nurse told Crossroads correspondent Louis LeWeigh: \u201cMr. Hannity isn\u2019t going to survive. At this time they\u2019re calling in close friends and family so he can share goodbyes. It\u2019s very sad. He\u2019s awake and lucid and while he\u2019s in a lot of pain, he\u2019s in good spirits. He cried for a solid ten minutes when we told him his injusries were fatal. He couldn\u2019t believe God already wanted him home.\u201d Hannity has already been given the last rights by his priest and is now sitting with his mother and younger sister. Fox and the other networks have still made no announcements, possibly at the family\u2019s request.  None of this was true, as the story originated solely with America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a fake news site whose disclaimer notes that it \u201cis a satirical publication\u201d which \u201cpresents fiction as fact\u201d from \u201csources [that] don\u2019t actually exist.\u201d America\u2019s Last Line of Defense doubled down the next day with an equally fake follow-up article holding that Hannity had faked his own death in order to catch an Internet terrorist:  An internet terrorist calling himself \u201cThe Engine\u201d has been infiltrating political action groups for months, intent on causing the destruction of our fair election systems. The closest anyone ever came was the name of a nurse who supposedly had treated him and sworn herself to secrecy. That nurse, Nancy Higgins of New York Mercy, was the only chance of catching The Engine in person. When the idea came across Hannity\u2019s desk, he selflessly volunteered to be the victim of the hoax and to involve himself in a minor traffic accident on a bicycle. The idea was to use a reporter to get close enough to Higgins to clone her cell phone, which led to the arrest and immediate deportation of The Engine to his home country of Caledonia.  "

    "content": " As governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Read our coronavirus fact checks. Submit any questionable rumors and \u201cadvice\u201d you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.   In early April 2020, social media users shared an essay on Facebook claiming, among other things, that the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic was the result of a biological weapon created by the Chinese government. The essay text began with \u201cWritten by Bill O\u2019Reilly,\u201d which prompted many readers to write to Snopes, asking whether the former Fox News host and political commentator had in fact written it.  The essay attributed to O\u2019Reilly amplifies a widely debunked conspiracy theory that posits the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the result of a human-made bioweapon as opposed to a new, naturally occurring virus. It reads, in part:  The communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity. Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy, like a deceptive fox. In my opinion, I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn\u2019t kill everyone, but kills \u201cenough,\u201d especially the elderly and in-firmed. Back in WW 2 Hitler thought the same way. He got rid of what he considered the useless and rejects of society.         However, we found no evidence that O\u2019Reilly, who currently publishes commentary on his own website, wrote the essay in question. Readers reported spotting the essay on Facebook and also in forwarded emails. But it was not posted by O\u2019Reilly on his website or his social media accounts. We also found no evidence via other news sources that O\u2019Reilly promoted the debunked conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 pandemic was an act of biological warfare by the Chinese government. In point of fact, the essay\u2019s true author appears to be a Facebook user named Tim Besmer Sr., who posted it to his page on April 2 with a copyright notice in his own name and the words \u201cPermission given for public sharing\u201d appended. At that time, the post was labeled \u201cFalse\u201d by Facebook\u2019s independent fact-checking partners. We have not been able to ascertain who added O\u2019Reilly\u2019s byline to the essay, but within days of its initial posting a version appeared containing both Besmer\u2019s name and O\u2019Reilly\u2019s, followed by variants attributed to O\u2019Reilly alone. In a statement to Snopes, a representative for O\u2019Reilly\u2019s website confirmed that \u201cBill O\u2019Reilly did not write a single word of the essay in question,\u201d adding that the pundit \u201cdoes not traffic in conspiracy theories.\u201d We therefore rate this quoted item \u201cMisattributed.\u201d "

NYC Police Sargeant Michael O\u2019Leary told reporters that while he couldn\u2019t confirm the identity of the driver, a well-known news anchor was rammed in what looked like an act of violence and not an accident. EMT\u2019s on the scene were heard on their radios describing the man as Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson after retrieving his wallet. He was transported to Saint Mary\u2019s where he is said to be in critical condition and awaiting surgery. No other information is available from the hospital, which also refuses to release anything until they get the OK from police. This report was followed up by one claiming that Carlson had succumbed to his injuries, and police had found that the traffic mishap that resulted in Carlson\u2019s death was no \u201caccident\u201d: Fox News superstar Tucker Carlson succumbed to his injuries and died overnight after being hit head-on while driving home. The Ford Explorer that crossed the median to slam into him was stolen, reinforced to sustain a head-on collision without killing the driver and left at the scene. After a preliminary investigation, police have ruled out an accident and Carlson\u2019s cause of death has been ruled a homicide. None of this was true. These reports originated solely with America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a clickbait fake news site which engages in political trolling under the guise of producing \u201csatire\u201d \u2014 and which published the very same sequence of fake news articles (i.e., \u201cconservative political figure injured in car crash, incident later discovered to be no accident\u201d) about former Alaska governor Sarah Palin a month earlier.  Tucker Carlson remains alive and uninjured. "

Trump was indeed unhappy with Wallace over an interview with U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., about the ongoing impeachment hearings against the president. Trump has been accused by a whistleblower of attempting to extort damaging information from Ukraine about a political rival by withholding crucial military aid. Wallace had challenged Scalise, a defender of Trump, on several points. The interview can be viewed here:  Both Wallace and Trump are the sons of prominent fathers. Wallace is the son of the late CBS \u201c60 Minutes\u201d journalist Mike Wallace, while Trump\u2019s father, Fred Trump, was a prolific developer who was responsible for building the Trump family\u2019s real estate empire.

The actor and the Fox News host have a friendly relationship, and the two couples spent some time together at Clooney\u2019s home in Lake Como, Italy, in August of 2012. The photographs seen above can be glimpsed in a contemporaneous Politico video interview of Wallace, during which the host described his four-day vacation with his wife at Clooney\u2019s Italian home.
