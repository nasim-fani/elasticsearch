    "claim": "From an internet advertisement: \"No One Realizes How Dangerous This Popular Vacation Spot in California Actually Is.\"",
    "content": " Internet advertisements that include phrases like \u201cyou won\u2019t believe what happens next\u201d and \u201cdoctors hate him\u201d have dominated the online landscape for years, often failing to deliver on their promises, and leaving readers clicking through endless slideshows with no payoff. One such advertisement that appeared to be clickbait showed a girl jumping into what looked like a vertical hole in a lake, with the text: \u201cNo One Realizes How Dangerous This Popular Vacation Spot in California Actually Is.\u201d The image was real, but it had nothing to do with the state of California. The photograph depicted Jacob\u2019s Well, a popular destination for swimming in Hays County, Texas. It is the second-largest fully submerged cave in the state. The image of Jacob\u2019s Well had also appeared on Reddit and Pinterest in the past. We were unable to find the name of the photographer.  The advertisement that claimed \u201cno one realizes how dangerous this popular vacation spot in California actually is\u201d was hosted by Outbrain, and the landing page after clicking the advertisement went to Icepop. Outbrain facilitated the technology that allowed Icepop to run the advertisement. However, Icepop created the content. Icepop\u2019s strategy appeared to be what has become known as advertising arbitrage. We described arbitrage in a previous story that falsely claimed \u201cJeopardy\u201d host Alex Trebek\u2019s net worth \u201cleft his family in tears\u201d following his passing. The basic idea is to make more money by displaying advertisements on each Icepop slideshow page than it had cost to run the Outbrain advertisement that led readers to the slideshow in the first place.         In the case of Jacob\u2019s Well, it appeared on page two of the slideshow, which is quite early compared to other instances of arbitrage. However, the image was quite different than the one that appeared in the advertisement, and since it did not feature California, Icepop\u2019s strategy for the advertisement may have been to keep readers clicking until they found the image from the advertisement. The image from the advertisement did not make an appearance in the slideshow story. The Hays County website described the history of Jacob\u2019s Well, including how it earned the name: Jacob\u2019s Well Natural Area consists of five land surveys that all use the spring as a corner to tie the properties together. These surveys were conducted in 1847 by a prominent surveyor names Bartlett Sims. In the early 1850\u2019s William C. Winters, a San Jacinto veteran and early settler of Wimberley, hiked up Cypress Creek searching for its source and found an overflowing spring. It is said that Mr. Winters exclaimed \u201clike unto a well in Bible times.\u201d Thus it was named \u2018Jacob\u2019s Well\u2019. The property changed hands many times over the next 100 years and became a popular recreational destination. Jacob\u2019s Well Natural Area remains a popular recreational destination today. The county also noted that the deepest part of the cavern system is 140 feet deep, and that the main cavern length is 4,341 feet. Wimberley Valley Watershed published an informative video on Jacob\u2019s Well Natural Area, which included details on its Native American history. It is true that a handful of people have drowned at Jacob\u2019s Well, but it is false that \u201cno one realizes how dangerous\u201d it is. On top of Jacob\u2019s Well being featured on Reddit and Pinterest, tales of its dangers also appeared in San Antonio Express-News, Discovery, Swimmer\u2019s Daily, All That\u2019s Interesting, and others. On Nov. 26, 1983, an Associated Press story was published in Salisbury, Maryland\u2019s, The Daily Times. It detailed a number of drownings at Jacob\u2019s Well:         In 1984, Wayne W. Russell, Jr. became the ninth fatality at Jacob\u2019s Well. Treehugger linked to a particularly frightening video that purported to show someone freediving around 100 feet (30 meters) into the water without scuba gear.      A Reddit post claimed to show a sign near the entrance to the cave below where swimmers jump into the water.  However, that sign didn\u2019t appear in any diving videos, and may have been shot at Eagle\u2019s Next Sinkhole in Florida, where multiple people have died in the past. The sign also appeared in a YouTube video from a cave dive in Mexico. In sum, Jacob\u2019s Well is a real and dangerous tourist attraction that has led to multiple drownings in the past. However, it\u2019s false to say that it\u2019s located in California, and also not true that \u201cno one\u201d is aware of its dangers. Hays County announced on its parks department phone line that Jacob\u2019s Well would be closed for the remainder of 2020 for \u201caquatic restoration,\u201d and would not reopen for swimming until May 2021.

    "claim": "An old camera found in the deep ocean revealed horrifying Titanic photos.",
    "content": " The history of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 has been plagued by tall tales, conspiracy theories, and urban legends. The Titanic\u2019s story perhaps became more popular than ever with James Cameron\u2019s release of the 1997 blockbuster epic of the same name. Speaking of Cameron, even the film\u2019s shooting was marked by a questionable occurrence, in which a chef on set laced the seafood chowder with PCP, causing some cast and crew to be sick. Since at least November 2020, an advertisement promoted on the Taboola advertising platform read: \u201cOld Camera Found In The Deep Ocean Reveals Horrifying Titanic Photos.\u201d A website, Floor8, appeared to take a frame from the 1997 film and change it to appear black and white. The advertisement was placed by Floor8, and clicking on it led curious readers to a Floor8 story with a title different than the advertisement: \u201cHere\u2019s What the Last Days of the Titanic Were Really Like.\u201d The story was originally published by Two Red Dots, and mentioned nothing about an \u201cold camera\u201d being \u201cfound in the deep ocean.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if Two Red Dots was related to Floor8. This is what\u2019s known as advertising arbitrage. The strategy is to provide something interesting in the advertisement, often something that is highly misleading, and then to land readers on a slideshow-style story where they must click sometimes hundreds of times to finish the slideshow. The advertisers aim to make more money on the slideshow clicks than they spent to advertise the story in the first place. We previously covered other stories about arbitrage, including one that falsely said Alex Trebek\u2019s family was \u201cin tears\u201d after they saw his net worth following his death, another that claimed a dangerous vacation spot was in California (it wasn\u2019t), and yet another that misled readers into believing former actress and model Evelyn Nesbit was part of Wild West history. The remaining wreckage from the Titanic was estimated to be 12,600 feet (3,840 meters) underwater. Had a camera from the early 20th century been recovered near the ocean floor after around 100 years, the images could certainly not be recovered. While an old camera with \u201chorrifying Titanic photos\u201d was not found in the deep ocean, it is true that a young girl named Bernice Palmer shot photographs of the iceberg that ripped open the Titanic, resulted in its sinking. She also captured images of survivors. The Natural Museum of American History published that Palmer carried a handheld camera on the ship that responded to the Titanic\u2019s distress call: In 1900, the Eastman Kodak Company came out with the handheld box camera known as the \u201cBrownie.\u201d An immediate hit, more than 100,000 were sold in its first year. Canadian Bernice \u201cBernie\u201d Palmer received a Kodak Brownie box camera, either for Christmas 1911 or for her birthday on January 10th, 1912.     In early April, Bernie and her mother boarded the Cunard liner Carpathia in New York, for a Mediterranean cruise. Carpathia had scarcely cleared New York, when it received a distress call from the White Star liner Titanic on 14 April. It raced to the scene of the sinking and managed to rescue over 700 survivors from the icy North Atlantic. With her new camera, Bernice took pictures of the iceberg that sliced open the Titanic\u2019s hull below the waterline and also took snapshots of some of the Titanic survivors. After arriving back in New York, Palmer was approached by an employee with Underwood &amp; Underwood, a New York photography agency. They negotiated a deal for $10 so that Underwood &amp; Underwood could develop and use the photographs, what the Smithsonian Institution today called \u201ca pittance.\u201d Palmer may not have realized at the time that the pictures would be worth so much more money. Her photographs and the Underwood &amp; Underwood contract can be viewed on the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s website. "

    "claim": "The Obamas had their dog, Bo, flown on his own airplane to join them on vacation.",
    "content": " In 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was dogged by a false rumor that he had accidentally left his Scottish terrier, Fala, behind during a trip to the Aleutian Islands and had ordered a U.S. Navy destroyer to the islands solely to retrieve his pooch \u2014 at a cost of millions of dollars to U.S. taxpayers. In a famous speech, Roosevelt deftly used humor to puncture his political opponents and deflate the rumor, saying:  You know Fala is Scotch, and being a Scotty, as soon as he learned that the Republican fiction writers, in Congress and out,  had concocted a story that I\u2019d left him behind on an Aleutian island and had sent a destroyer back to find him, at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three or eight or twenty million dollars, his Scotch soul was furious \u2026 He has not been the same dog since.  In July 2010, a similar rumor attached to another Democratic president, Barack Obama, when an unfounded claim was circulated stating that the Obamas\u2019 family pup, a Portuguese water dog named Bo, had been flown out to Maine on his own plane (i.e., on a flight arranged for no purpose other than transporting a dog) so he could be on hand to greet the First Family when they arrived in that state for a weekend vacation:  BO\u2019S VACATION IN MASSACHUSETTS I guess since they had to swallow their pride and use the Gulfstream there just wasn\u2019t enough room for the dog and one other person on Air Force One. Did you know that President Barack Hussein Obama flew Bo, their dog, in on a separate smaller jet to Massachusetts for their vacation? I wonder if that sets well with all the unemployed, hurting, U S citizens who can\u2019t afford food, but we can pay for this. The above is true.  This rumor was based on a single sentence in a Waterville, Maine, newspaper article about the Obamas\u2019 visit, which was misinterpreted to mean that Bo had flown on a plane accompanied only by a single handler:  Arriving in a small jet before the Obamas was the first dog, Bo, a Portuguese water dog given as a present by the late U.S. Sen Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.; and the president\u2019s personal aide Reggie Love, who chatted with [Gov. John] Baldacci.          Bo flew to Maine in a different plane than the rest of the First Family not because he was part of a special canine-only flight, but because the local airport (Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport in Trenton, Maine) was too small to accommodate the Boeing 747-200B in which the President usually travels.  Therefore, the Obamas flew to Maine in a Gulfstream GIII/G3 jet (which seats six to nineteen passengers), while Bo was loaded onto an earlier flight which carried a contingent of presidential aides and staff members.   The Waterville Morning Sentinel later added an amplification to their original article about the Obamas\u2019 visit, noting that:  Today\u2019s story about the arrival of the Obamas said the Obama\u2019s dog and one aide arrived on a small jet before the First Family, but there were other occupants on the plane, including several other staffers. The presidential party took two small jets to the Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport in Trenton because the airport was too small to accommodate the president\u2019s usual jet.  Similar claims were trotted out again during the First Family\u2019s vacation at Martha\u2019s Vineyard in August 2013, when articles (such as a Telegraph piece entitled \u201cFirst Dog Bo Is Airlifted to Obama Holiday Home\u201d) were misleadingly proffered as proof that Bo was flown from Washington to the Obamas\u2019 Massachusetts vacation spot on his very own Marine helicopter.   The truth is that President Obama\u2019s 747-200B aircraft did not land at Martha\u2019s Vineyard Airport when he traveled there; instead, it touched down at nearby Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, and the presidential party was then flown the short distance to Martha\u2019s Vineyard Airport via helicopter.  In August 2013 Bo simply flew the last leg of the trip, from Cape Cod to Martha\u2019s Vineyard (a distance of about six miles), ahead of the Obamas on a helicopter that was already ferrying presidential aides, reporters, and baggage to the latter destination:  President Obama arrived on the Vineyard late Saturday afternoon to begin an eight-day summer vacation with his family. Air Force One touched down at Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod in Bourne at 3.24 p.m. Saturday. Marine One touched down at the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Airport just before 4 p.m. carrying President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. Two Osprey MV-22 helicopters landed ahead of time with staff and press. The president and First Lady left Marine One and boarded a black car. Two white mesh bags full of basketballs were unloaded from one of the Osprey, and first dog Bo also traveled on [one of the] Osprey. He waited patiently on the tarmac with a handler.    IN THE MUSLIM RELIGION, DOGS ARE UNCLEAN AND NOT ALLOWED TO TRAVEL IN THE SAME VEHICLE AS THE MUSLIM. Bo has never traveled in the same means of transportation with the First Family.   Bo has most certainly traveled with the First Family. Here are a representative group of news articles that mention the dog's being with them:   \"As the president and his family headed to Martha's Vineyard &mdash; after a brief delay while a weakening Hurricane Bill swept past the island &mdash; a surprise visitor ambled through the media cabin on Air Force One: Bo, the first dog.\"  Vacation Time for the First Family Michael Shear, Washington Post, 24 August 2009.   \"Obama made a surprise visit to the press cabin of Air Force One with the furry pooch, but like his owner, the pup quickly headed back to the front of the plane. The president, wearing shirtsleeves and a broad smile, watched as Bo walked up and down the aisle collecting pats from reporters.\"  First Return Trip in a Year Carol Lee, Politico, 27 May 2010.  \"Then it was off with the [President's] suit and tie, onto Air Force One with first dog Bo, and away for a 10-day break.\"  Slideshow: The Obamas on Vacation The Grio, 20 August 2010.  --> "

    "claim": "Photographs of actress Evelyn Nesbit are accurate representations of \"Wild West\" history.",
    "content": " As we\u2019ve noted in debunked stories about Alex Trebek\u2019s net worth and a dangerous vacation spot in California, internet advertisements that lead to slideshow lists aren\u2019t exactly credible sources of information. Since at least November 2020, a photograph of former actress and model Florence Evelyn Nesbit, better known as Evelyn Nesbit, was featured in an internet ad that promised: \u201cHistorical Wild West photos \u2013 Discretion Advised.\u201d The advertisement was placed by a website named Bon Voyaged, and was likely years old. Bon Voyaged used the Outbrain advertising platform to place the advertisement, and the resulting landing page from 2016 was on the Bon Voyaged website. Once readers landed on Bon Voyaged, they were encouraged to click 80 times through a slideshow to see \u201cAmazing Wild West Photos\u201d \u2014 none of which featured Evelyn Nesbit. Nesbit lived from 1884 (or 1885) to 1967. Her birth year is unclear, as spelled out in the book \u201cAmerican Eve: Evelyn Nesbit, Stanford White, the Birth of the \u2018It\u2019 Girl, and the Crime of the Century\u201d by Paula Uruburu, a professor of English and film studies at Hofstra University. Nesbit lived the early years of her life in Pennsylvania, including in Natrona, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia, cities that were not part of the so-called Wild West. Uruburu wrote that Nesbit was photographed in Philadelphia around the age of 14 or 15, which set off a firestorm of interest in her physical appearance: Not long after the suggestion was made, Ryland Phillips, a Philadelphia photographer who had heard from John Storm about the fetching fifteen-year-old, arranged for her to sit for some photographic studies. Or rather stand. Throughout the session, Phillips had Florence Evelyn lean casually against a wall, clad in a floor-length milky white satin gown, with her hair falling softly to one side. Unlike the painters, who preferred her without makeup, however, the photographer put some eye makeup and lipstick on Evelyn, subtle touches that nonetheless gave her a startlingly more mature appearance. Phillips was extraordinarily pleased by the pictures in which, he said, she resembled \u201ca young Aphrodite.\u201d He managed to have them printed in an art magazine, where they attracted a good deal of attention; they were then reproduced in the Philadelphia newspapers (and once again a year or two later in \u201cBroadway Magazine\u201d).         Nesbit then moved to New York City, where she became an \u201covernight success.\u201d In 1901, she posed for the photograph that, more than a century later, was used in the 2020 internet advertisement from Bon Voyaged:  It appeared to be a photograph from Otto Sarony\u2019s studio. Uruburu noted that Sarony\u2019s work was mostly theatrical subjects. Some of his studio\u2019s photographs are still available today on eBay. This cabinet card appeared to show another photograph taken during the same session.  In author Jim Alessio\u2019s book, \u201cThe Eternal Flapper: The Many Lives of Edna Wallace Hopper,\u201d he wrote that Otto Sarony and his father, Napoleon Sarony, \u201cmass-marketed\u201d their images, and unaccredited photographers actually shot the photographs. Sarony Studio dominated the theatrical portraiture market during the last half of the 19th century, remained a power in theater publicity circles until the mid-1920s, and a viable brand as a portrait studio until late in the 20th century. [Napoleon] proved to be the most enterprising celebrity photographer of the post-Civil War era. His studio on Fifth Avenue, a famously extravagant temple of odd props, old art, and stuffed exotic wildlife, hosted sittings with the important personages of the era. Nesbit\u2019s life was marked by a love triangle, murder, and the \u201ctrial of the century.\u201d Uruburu was asked by PBS\u2019s \u201cAmerican Experience\u201d why people are still so fascinated with Nesbit\u2019s story. She answered: \u201cIt has all the elements \u2014 sex and violence, love and betrayal, a teen-aged girl involved with a married man, an insanely jealous husband driven to murder. Moreover, it involves a supremely beautiful girl who was an icon of her age, the fall of the rich and powerful, the cult of celebrity that is now so familiar, but which at the time was brand new.\u201d In the early 20th century, Nesbit\u2019s image had been used in advertising campaigns to draw in revenue, including for a lumber company. Uruburu wrote in her book: \u201cFlorence Evelyn was dubbed the \u2018modern Helen\u2019 by one columnist, and her evocative and soon familiar face launched any number of advertising campaigns as canny entrepreneurs began to capitalize on her uncanny ability to appeal to both sexes and appear chaste and alluring at the same time.\u201d More than 100 years later, advertisers still appeared to be using Nesbit\u2019s image for revenue.

    "claim": "A photograph shows a security wall outside Joe Kennedy's Palm Beach house.",
    "content": " One of the most salient moments from Rep. Joe Kennedy III\u2019s (D-Mass.) response to State of the Union address came when he rebuked President Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall along the Mexican border in an attempt to stop illegal immigration: America, we carry that story on our shoulders. [\u2026] You probably marched together last weekend, thousands deep, on the streets of Las Vegas and Philadelphia and Nashville. You sat high atop your mom\u2019s shoulders and held a sign that read \u201cBuild a wall and my generation will tear it down.\u201d Some attempted to paint Kennedy as hypocritical for this comment by passing around a photograph purportedly showing \u201cJoe Kennedy\u2019s House\u201d and the security wall that protected it:  There are a number of problems with using this photograph to paint Kennedy as a hypocrite for promising to tear down a border wall.          Chiefly, this is not Joe Kennedy\u2019s house, and hasn\u2019t been in the Kennedy family\u2019s holdings for more than 20 years. This property was purchased by Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., Joe Kennedy III\u2019s great grandfather, in 1933, but the property hasn\u2019t been in the Kennedy family for more than two decades. The Kennedy family sold the property in 1995, when Kennedy III was just 14 years old, according to the New York Times:  The Kennedy days in Palm Beach quietly ended today with the sale of the oceanfront property that Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. bought in 1933 as a vacation spot and that later became his son\u2019s winter White House and eventually a symbol of the family\u2019s troubles. Claiming that the pictured wall was designed to keep people off the property is also misleading. Kennedy\u2019s critics may be under the impression that a wall\u2019s sole purpose is to keep immigrants from crossing a border, but walls have several other purposes\u2014especially in coastal Florida, where hurricanes are known to wreak havoc. In this case, this wall is a seawall designed to keep the ocean, not undocumented immigrants, from damaging the property.  This house is located on Palm Beach, just a few feet from the ocean. A view of the property from Google Earth shows that a sea wall also protects neighboring properties:  It\u2019s true that this photograph shows a wall outside of a house. However, this house does not belong to Joe Kennedy III (and hasn\u2019t been owned by his family since 1995) and the pictured wall is a sea wall, not a border wall, designed to protect the house from the ocean tides.

    "content": " On 20 May 2016, the video shown above, purportedly capturing \u201crain falling in one place\u201d in Togo was posted to YouTube.  However, what was depicted in the video did not occur \u201cthis morning\u201d (i.e., 20 May 2016), nor did it take place in Togo. The video has been circulating online since at least June 2015, when it was shared under the title \u201cSources of water, water sources of well digging.\u201d While that version of the video did not include mention of a location, other postings of it have placed the incident in Indonesia, China, and Vietnam. This video also doesn\u2019t show \u201crain falling in one place.\u201d In fact, it doesn\u2019t show rain at all. The water in the  video is coming up from the ground (not down from the sky), either from a natural geyser or a burst pipe. The water spurt displayed in this video appears as if it were coming from the sky largely because its peak  is hidden by tree branches or is simply out of frame. When the peak is in view, the color of the water and the sky are too similar to easily distinguish one from the other. However, a careful examination of this footage shows that the water clearly originates from the ground and not the sky. The first clue is that a central water column can be periodically glimpsed throughout the video. The water is erupting from a hole in the ground and then falling back to the ground:            The peak of this geyser can also be glimpsed at several points in the video, and at the 1:17 mark viewers can actually see the height of the geyser briefly change:  A simliar shot of a burst high-pressure water main on Akosombo Road in Ghana has also been circulated with the same claim of its depicting \u201crain falling on only one spot\u201d:  The true nature of the phenomenon is more obvious in this clip taken from a different angle:  "
