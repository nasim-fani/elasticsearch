    "claim": "Photographs show a metallic, nonnatural monolith that was discovered in Utah. ",
    "content": " In November 2020, photographs and videos supposedly showing a monolith that was discovered somewhere in Utah started to circulate on social media: While we don\u2019t know too much about what this object is or who put it there, this is a genuine image of a surprising discovery. This photograph was taken by the Utah Department of Public Safety Aero Bureau and was posted to their official social media pages on Nov. 20. The bureau explained that they discovered the monolith a few days before while conducting a count of big horn sheep in the area.  The Bureau wrote on Instagram: \u201cCounting big horn sheep with DWR this week. During the counts we came across this, in the middle of nowhere, buried deep in the rock. Inquiring minds want to know, what the heck is it? Anyone? \ud83d\udc7d?\u201d In a news release, the organization said that the discovery was made on Nov. 18 somewhere in southeastern Utah. The group did not want to give the exact location of the object, fearing that \u2014 since it was in an isolated area \u2014 it would lead to visitors who could potentially get lost and stranded. The object is made of metal and judging from the photographs it stands over 10 feet tall. While it\u2019s unclear who erected this monolith, the government agency noted that it was illegal \u201cto install structures or art without authorization on federally managed public lands, no matter what planet you\u2019re from.\u201d         Here\u2019s the full press release and some additional photographs of the monolith: On November 18, 2020, the Utah Department of Public Safety Aero Bureau was working with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources to conduct a count of big horn sheep in a portion of southeastern Utah. While on this mission, they spotted an unusual object and landed nearby to investigate further. The crew members found a metal monolith installed in the ground in a remote area of red rock. The crew said there was no obvious indication of who might have put the monolith there. The exact location of the installation is not being disclosed since it is in a very remote area and if individuals were to attempt to visit the area, there is a significant possibility they may become stranded and require rescue. It is illegal to install structures or art without authorization on federally managed public lands, no matter what planet you\u2019re from. The Bureau of Land Management will be determining if they need to investigate further.     While we can\u2019t say for certain where this monolith comes from, the most likely explanation is that it was some form of art installation. It\u2019s possible that it was undertaken in the same spirit as the crop circle hoaxes that popped up around England in the 1970s and convinced a generation of people that aliens were communicating via corn fields. A monolith is defined in the dictionary as a \u201cgreat stone often in the form of an obelisk or column,\u201d but this word has become closely associated with alien encounters, thanks in large part to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1968 film \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d In fact, the monolith that was discovered in Utah bares a resemblance to the alien monolith depicted in the film:      It should also be noted that although news of this mysterious monolith went viral in November 2020, imagery from Google Maps indicates that the odd artifact has been in its current location since at least 2015-16. Here are a few additional videos of this monolith from the Utah Department of Public Safety:          Shortly after these images went viral, it was reported that this mysterious monolith had \u201cdisappeared.\u201d But there was nothing otherworldly about its disappearance. USA Today reported that four humans removed the structure from the area. Monolith mania continued through the end of November as a similar structure was found in Romania.  As of this writing, the most likely explanation for these monoliths continues to be artists/bored humans.  "

    "content": " In the winter months of 2020, oblong metallic structures appeared and vanished in various locations, creating something of a public mystery \u2014 in part because the objects\u2019 appearance reminded some of the famous monolith in the 1968 science fiction film \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d After making a splash and appearing in Utah on Nov. 18, 2020, a monolith appeared in Romania less than two weeks later. Both mysteriously disappeared days after they were found. Then on Dec. 2, a third one was found on Pine Mountain in Atascadero, a city in central California\u2019s coastal San Luis Obispo County.  \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 BREAKING NEWS \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8  There is currently a monolith at the top of Pine Mountain in Atascadero!! (Photos by @Atownreporter) pic.twitter.com/0vPhEWYkeY \u2014 Connor Allen (@ConnorCAllen) December 2, 2020  According to the local newspaper, The Atascadero News, the monolith has become an attraction for hikers in the area: The three-sided obelisk appeared to be made of stainless steel, 10-feet tall and 18 inches wide. The object was welded together at each corner, with rivets attaching the side panels to a likely steel frame inside. The top of the monument did not show any weld marks, and it appears to be hollow at the top, and possibly bottom. Unlike its Utah sibling, the Atascadero obelisk was not attached to the ground, and could be knocked over with a firm push. The Atascadero News estimates it weighs about 200 pounds. As of this writing, there is no publicly-known explanation as to who is responsible for the objects or why they are appearing, although a working hypothesis is that they are part of a guerrilla art installation. Some joked that the monoliths were the work of extraterrestrials. The monolith was torn down overnight by a group of white supremacists decked out in gear labeled with the campaign slogan of U.S. President Donald Trump, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d as reported by Vice on Dec. 3, 2020. One of the men stated on a livestream video of their activity, \u201cChrist is king in this country. We don\u2019t want illegal aliens from Mexico or outer space.\u201d "

    "claim": "The Georgia Guidestones were stolen from their site and then re-erected in New Hampshire. ",
    "content": " In July 2017, NCScooper.com published two stories about the Georgia Guidestones, a mysterious granite monument constructed in the 1980s by an artist under a pseudonym, and inscribed with ten guidelines that are meant to provide humanity with a blueprint for the means to exist on the earth. Whether it is meant to re-establish order after a global apocalypse or is simply something toward which its creators wish humanity to collectively strive is unclear: Engraved in the stones are ten guidelines meant to re-establish the planet and society, perhaps after an apocalypse. They are written in eight different languages, English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese and Russian, and among other commandments preach to: \u2013 Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature. \u2013 Rule passion \u2013 faith \u2013 tradition \u2013 and all things with tempered reason. \u2013 Balance personal rights with social duties. \u2013 Be not a cancer on the earth \u2013 Leave room for nature. The guidestones also serve as an astronomical calendar, and every day at noon the sun shines through a narrow hole in the structure and illuminates the day\u2019s date on an engraving. The names of four ancient languages are inscribed on the sides near the top: Babylonian cuneiform, Classical Greek, Sanskrit, and Egyptian Hieroglyphics. Additionally an instructional tablet at the site speaks of a time capsule buried underneath the surface, though the dates on which the capsule was buried and when it is to be re-opened are missing. Whether this is intentional or the capsule was never buried is unknown. Naturally, the stones have been the focus of a whole string of conspiracy theories. These articles had little to do with the pre-existing conspiracy theories, however. The first reported that the giant granite slabs had been stolen, and the second article said that they reappeared in New Hampshire: The Georgia Guidestones, which is a mysterious granite monument erected in the early 1980s that contains a set of 10 guidelines in eight modern languages, has been stolen according to Elbert County Sheriff officials. What baffles investigators is how anyone one could have moved the 200 ton slabs without anyone noticing. \u201cSomeone or something came in late last night and took them,\u201d said Elbert County Sheriff Shayne Heap speaking in an early morning press conference. \u201cThose things are really heavy and it would take a large crew and heavy machinery to move them. We also have no motive in the crime, but there always has been a lot of mischief around the Stones.\u201d NCScooper.com is an entertainment web site that does not publish factual stories, and these stories are untrue and not meant to be taken seriously. The web site explains in its biting \u201cmanifesto\u201d that its content is satirical in nature and intended to be read as such:  First off, what kind of dolt reads a manifesto? Answer we do and apparently so do you. So congrats. The Scooper is a satirical website is in scope and intent. Sometimes it\u2019s funny; often it is not. in scope and intent. It provides social criticism in a satirical, sometimes news-genre setting. We are not a \u201cfake news\u201d site, but rather an entertainment one. Sometimes it\u2019s just plain-old crappy writing with a few bad jokes. Our intention is not to fool or trick anyone, but obviously it happens. We firmly believe that you can soften a person\u2019s willingness to listen by injecting irony, and yes sometimes humor, into the conversation. The Georgia Guidestones is a real (and unusual) monument that was commissioned by an anonymous group in the 1980s, contains a set of instructions for rebuilding humanity after doomsday that is written in several different languages, and functions as a clock, a calendar, and a compass: Approaching the edifice, it\u2019s hard not to think immediately of England\u2019s Stonehenge or possibly the ominous monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Built in 1980, these pale gray rocks are quietly awaiting the end of the world as we know it. Called the Georgia Guidestones, the monument is a mystery\u2014nobody knows exactly who commissioned it or why. The only clues to its origin are on a nearby plaque on the ground\u2014which gives the dimensions and explains a series of intricate notches and holes that correspond to the movements of the sun and stars\u2014and the \u201cguides\u201d themselves, directives carved into the rocks. These instructions appear in eight languages ranging from English to Swahili and reflect a peculiar New Age ideology. Some are vaguely eugenic (guide reproduction wisely\u2014improving fitness and diversity); others prescribe standard-issue hippie mysticism (prize truth\u2014beauty\u2014love\u2014seeking harmony with the infinite). What\u2019s most widely agreed upon\u2014based on the evidence available\u2014is that the Guidestones are meant to instruct the dazed survivors of some impending apocalypse as they attempt to reconstitute civilization. Although, as mentioned, these odd guidestones are often the subjects of conspiracy theories, the claims that they were stolen and then moved to New Hampshire originated from a satire page. "

    "claim": "Large concrete arrows set on the ground guided early airmail pilots across the U.S.",
    "content": " In the 1920s, the U.S. Post Office began experimenting with cross-country delivery of mail by air. Before the advent of radio guidance, mail pilots picked their way along from visible landmark to visible landmark, a system that somewhat served where there were recognizable geological or man-made features to be guided by, but not at all in areas such as vast stretches of empty, repetitive desert. In 1924, in recognition that its pilots needed more help finding their way, the Post Office began erecting combinations of large concrete arrows and lighted beacons along its established airmail routes:  This Really Exists:  Giant Concrete Arrows That Point Your Way Across America\u2026 Every so often, usually in the vast deserts of the American Southwest, a hiker or a backpacker will run across something puzzling: a large concrete arrow, as much as seventy feet in length, sitting in the middle of scrub-covered nowhere.  What are these giant arrows? Some kind of surveying mark? Landing beacons for flying saucers? Earth\u2019s turn signals? No, it\u2019s\u2026 The Transcontinental Air Mail Route. On August 20, 1920, the United States opened its first coast-to-coast airmail delivery route, just 60 years after the Pony Express closed up shop. There were no good aviation charts in those days, so pilots had to eyeball their way across the country using landmarks. This meant that flying in bad weather was difficult, and night flying was just about impossible. The Postal Service solved the problem with the world\u2019s first ground-based civilian navigation system: a series of lit beacons that would extend from New York to San Francisco. Every ten miles, pilots would pass a bright yellow concrete arrow. Each arrow would be surmounted by a 51-foot steel tower &amp; lit by a million-candlepower rotating beacon. (A generator shed at the tail of each arrow powered the beacon.) Now mail could get from the Atlantic to the Pacific not in a matter of weeks, but in just 30 hours or so. Even the dumbest of air mail pilots, it seems, could follow a series of bright yellow arrows straight out of a Tex Avery cartoon. By 1924, just a year after Congress funded it, the line of giant concrete markers stretched from Rock Springs, Wyoming to Cleveland, Ohio. The next summer, it reached all the way to New York, and by 1929 it spanned the continent uninterrupted, the envy of postal systems worldwide. Radio and radar are, of course, infinitely less cool than a concrete Yellow Brick Road from sea to shining sea, but I think we all know how this story ends. New advances in communication and navigation technology made the big arrows obsolete, and the Commerce Department decommissioned the beacons in the 1940s. The steel towers were torn down and went to the war effort. But the hundreds of arrows remain. Their yellow paint is gone, their concrete cracks a little more with every winter frost, and no one crosses their path much, except for coyotes and tumbleweeds. But they\u2019re still out there.  Roughly every ten miles along these paths, mail pilots would encounter 50-foot towers topped with rotating lights at whose base were 50- to 70-foot concrete foundations that from the air looked like arrows. These course lights flashed a code to identify each beacon\u2019s number.  In 1926, the Post Office Department turned management of the beacons over to the Department of Commerce. The project was finished in 1929, thereby completing a route from New York to San Francisco.  When visibility wasn\u2019t impaired by weather conditions, the light from the next beacon could be seen from the one currently being flown over. Additionally, each arrow pointed to the next arrow, a feature that helped keep pilots on course when bad weather obscured the signal from the next lit beacon.  The arrow-and-beacon system did not long serve the country\u2019s aviators. By the early 1930s, technological advances (radio guidance and radar) began to give those flying over featureless terrain far more reliable methods of finding their way. These days, while scant few of the towers remain (many were disassembled for scrap metal during World War II), quite a number of those painted concrete arrows still dot the American landscape. "

    "claim": "The spiral stairway at Santa Fe's Loretto Chapel miraculously stands despite having no discernable means of support.",
    "content": " Fans of made-for-TV movies might recall The Staircase, a film (aired by CBS in 1998) starring Barbara Hershey as Mother Madalyn, a nun whose dying wish to see the construction of her order\u2019s chapel completed comes true through the efforts of a mysterious carpenter known only as \u201cJoad.\u201d  The movie was based on the legend of the Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the site of the \u201cmysterious staircase\u201d referred to in a widely-circuiated message:  City of Santa F\u00e9, in New Mexico, USA. A mystery of over 130 years and attracting around 250,000 visitors every year. Point of attention: Loretto Chapel. What makes this chapel different from all others is that the subject of the supposed miracle that took place in it is a staircase. A chapel was constructed somewhere in the 19th century. When it was ready, the nuns found that there was no staircase built to take them to the top level. They spent 9 days praying to St. Joseph, who was a carpenter. On the last day, a stranger knocked at their door and said that he was a carpenter who could help them build the staircase. He constructed the staircase, all by himself, which was considered to be the pride of carpentery. None knew how the staircase could stand by itself as it did not have a central support. Then the carpenter, who did not use a single nail or glue to construct this staircase, disappeared without even waiting for his payment. There was a rumour in the city of Santa F\u00e9 that the carpenter was St. Joseph himself, sent by Jesus Christ to attend to the nuns\u2019 problem. Since then, the staircase was called \u201cmiraculous\u201d and the site for pilgrimages. There are three mysteries about this staircase, says the spokesman of the chapel. The first mystery is that, to this day, the identity of the builder is not known. The second mystery is that the architects, engineers and scientists say that they cannot understand how this staircase can balance without any central support. The third mystery is from where did the wood come? They have checked and found out that the type of wood used to build the staircase does not exist in the entire region. There is another detail that has just increased the belief in the supposed miracle: The staircase has 33 steps, the age of Jesus Christ.  The Loretto Academy was a school for women founded in Santa Fe in 1852 by the local Sisters of Loretto.  In 1873 construction was begun to add a chapel to the site, a project plagued by some unfortunate incidents (including the shooting death of the main architect).  As the builders were finishing up work on the chapel, they found that the plans drawn up by the late architect had not included any means of access to the chapel\u2019s choir loft.  This was when, according to Alice Bullock\u2019s book, Loretto and the Miraculous Staircase, the now-legendary events kicked in. The notion of constructing an ordinary staircase up to the choir loft was apparently rejected both because it would have limited the available seating in the loft and because it would have been aesthetically unappealing.  As Bullock described the nuns\u2019 dilemma over how to proceed: \u201cCarpenters and builders were called in, only to shake their heads in despair. When all else had failed, the Sisters determined to pray a novena to the Master Carpenter himself, St. Joseph.\u201d As Bullock\u2019s narrative continues, the nuns\u2019 prayers were answered on the ninth day by a humble workman leading a burro loaded with a complement of carpentry tools.  The workman proclaimed that, with permission, he could resolve the dilemma, needing only a couple of water tubs to complete the task:     Sisters, going in to the Chapel to pray, saw the tubs with wood soaking in them, but the Man always withdrew while they said their prayers, returning to his work when the Chapel was free. Some there are who say the circular stair which stands there today was built very quickly. Others say no, it took quite a little time. But the stair did grow, rising solidly in a double helix without support of any kind and without nail or screw. The floor space used was minimal and the stair adds to, rather than detracts from, the beauty of the Chapel. The Sisters were overjoyed and planned a fine dinner to honor the Carpenter. Only he could not be found. No one seemed to know him, where he lived, nothing. Lumberyards were checked, but they had no bill for the Sisters of Loretto. They had not sold him the wood. Knowledgeable men went in and inspected the stair and none knew what kind of wood had been used, certainly nothing indigenous to this area. Advertisements for the Carpenter were run in the New Mexican and brought no response. \u201cSurely,\u201d said the devout, \u201cit was St. Joseph himself who built the stair\u201d          However it came to be built, the solution to the problem at the Loretto Chapel was a winding staircase in the shape of a helix (which both takes up less space than a conventional stairway and is much more aesthetically appealing).  Although winding staircases are somewhat tricky to build because the form is not well-suited to bearing weight and generally requires additional support, the one at Loretto is not quite the miracle of architecture that subsequent legend has made it out to be. For starters, the Loretto staircase was apparently not all that fine a piece of work from a safety standpoint.  It was originally built without a railing, presenting a steep descent that reportedly so frightened some of the nuns that they came down the stairway on their hands and knees.  Not until several years later did another artisan (Phillip August Hesch) finally add a railing to the staircase. Moreover, the helix shape acted like what it resembles, a big spring, with many visitors reporting that the stairs moved up and down as they trod them.  The structure has been closed to public access for several decades now, with various reasons (including a lack of suitable fire exits and \u201cpreservation\u201d) given for the closure at different times, leading investigator Joe Nickell to note that \u201cThere is reason to suspect that the staircase may be more unstable and, potentially, unsafe than some realize.\u201d Although the Loretto legend maintains that \u201cengineers and scientists say that they cannot understand how this staircase can balance without any central support\u201d and that by all rights it should have long since collapsed into a pile of rubble, none of that is the case.   Wood technologist Forrest N. Easley noted (as reported by the Skeptical Inquirer) that \u201cthe staircase does have a central support,\u201d an inner wood stringer of such small radius that it \u201cfunctions as an almost solid pole.\u201d  As well, Nickell observed when he visited Loretto in 1993 that the structure included an additional support, \u201can iron brace or bracket that stabilizes the staircase by rigidly connecting the outer stringer to one of the columns that support the loft.\u201d  Nickell concluded: \u201cIt would thus appear that the Loretto staircase is subject to the laws of physics like any other.\u201d  As for the wood used in the stairway\u2019s construction, it has been identified as spruce, but not a large enough sample has been made available for wood analysts to determine which of the ten spruce species found in North America (and thus precisely where) it came from.  That the structure may have built without the use of glue or nails is hardly remarkable: nails were often an unavailable or precious commodity to builders of earlier eras, who developed a number of techniques for fastening wood without them. All in all, nothing about Loretto\u2019s design or manufacture evidences any sign of the miraculous.  The staircase (and the chapel that houses it) is, however, now part of a privately-owned museum operated for profit, a situation that provides its owners with a strong financial motive for perpetuating the legend of its mysterious origins and substance.

There is no evidence that it was digitally altered, though it could have been manipulated during processing, printing, or reproduction at some earlier point in time. The photograph was available on the Getty Images licensing website with a helpful caption:  Historical Geography. 1900. Ireland. Here are some happy Ulster girls from a linen factory of North Ireland\u2019s chief city. Irish linen long ago made a name for itself, and many of the finest handkerchiefs and lingerie come from this source. The flax fibre is derived from the stalk of the plant. Each girl in the photograph has round her waist a cord sustaining various implements used in her work. (Photo by: SeM/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)         The photograph features 15 girls posing at a linen factory in Northern Ireland. The girl on the right side of the image, second row from the bottom, appears to have something on her shoulder.  While there appear to be \u201cghoulish\u201d fingers on her shoulder, referred to by \u201cInside Edition\u201d as a \u201cmysterious ghost hand,\u201d it could simply have been some of the materials used in the linen factory. As the caption noted, \u201ceach girl in the photograph has round her waist a cord sustaining various implements used in her work.\u201d Falling on the front side of the girl to the left of the girl in question is an example of the \u201cimplements\u201d that they worked with, which somewhat resemble the \u201cfingers\u201d on the other girl\u2019s shoulder.  At the same time, fourteen out of the fifteen girls in the photograph have their arms crossed in front of them. Perhaps the girl behind the girl in question simply wanted to cross her arms while also awkwardly putting her hand on the shoulder in front of her. We simply don\u2019t know.  A second photo from Getty Images also showed a linen factory in Belfast \u201ccirca 1900.\u201d However, it was unclear if it was the same factory. According to Yahoo, the photograph was sent into the website Belfast Live by a woman named Lynda, who said that the woman with the \u201cfingers\u201d on her shoulder was her grandmother, Ellen Donnelly.

    "content": " An image purportedly showing a strange creature that was terrorizing local residents as it roamed the streets of a small village in Argentina popped up on various conspiracy web sites and YouTube channels in early April 2018:   The creature\u2019s shape is striking, as it has not been connected with any known animal. Residents of Totoras in the province of Santa Fe report that a creature is wandering the streets and has even slain two dogs. Although this image was initially confined to web sites dedicated to aliens, UFOs and other \u201cunexplained\u201d mysteries, it also received coverage from more mainstream outlets such as The Mirror, where it was presented as if it were a genuine news item:\\ Monsters that roam the night are a myth, right? Demons only exist in Harry Potter books, don\u2019t they? So explain this terrifying footage of a mysterious creature terrorising a neighbourhood. The giant animal has so far butchered two dogs \u2014 a German Shepherd and a Pitbull. The pictured creature is not terrorizing a neighborhood in Argentina, nor did it slaughter any pet dogs. Why? Because this demon is fictional, existing only within the fantasy universe of the Harry Potter series of books.   This image was created by manipulating a piece of concept art for Remus Lupin, a professor afflicted by Lycanthropy, as depicted in the work Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. The image is available via the Pottermore web site, which also offers more backstory about the werewolf professor: It is established in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban that Remus Lupin, while a child, was bitten by the werewolf Fenrir Greyback. As an adult, he is able to take Wolfsbane Potion to control his condition, but he still struggles with the shame and weight of his secret, which the filmmakers brought out through costume and makeup. Here\u2019s a comparison of the Harry Potter concept art and the \u201cmysterious\u201d creature supposedly roaming Argentina (with the concept art flipped for a better comparison):  "
